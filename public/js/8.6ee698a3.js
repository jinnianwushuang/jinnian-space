Reach Your Dreams with these 7 valuable life hacks and have fun doing it!\r\n\r\n## 1. Be Confident and Positive\r\n\r\nThis is the backbone for all the other tips to reach your dreams. The more positive you are, the more you are open to opportunities and success. Law of Attraction states that whatever you put out comes back to you — so as you see the best in things and as you think highly of yourself, you begin to attract the people and situations into your life that will lead you to what you want. Think about it: when you are feeling down and frustrated, you probably aren’t very clear, focused or connected. You may be looking at the ground worrying, instead of making eye contact and striking up a wonderful conversation that might just change your life. Happy, successful people surround themselves with other happy people. So be confident, be positive and appreciate the little things as well as the big.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. Focus Forward & Visualize Your Dream\r\n\r\nIt can be all too easy to see how far you have to go and feel discouraged. Especially when you have inevitable setbacks. This is why it is so important to focus forward and visualize your dreams every day. Likely, your dreams won’t materialize overnight. But if you focus forward, and can see your dream in your mind before it happens, then your sub-conscious knows what to move toward. As you focus forward, imagine beautiful opportunities appearing before you. Imagine how good you feel living your dream life. Allow yourself to bask in this feeling and delight in the desire of what you want. As you do this, you are more open to receive goodness and your dreams will quickly begin to materialize. It can be extremely helpful to keep an appreciation journal, where you write down your dreams and goals in present tense. The whole point is to connect with how you will feel in your ideal future so you are feeling it Now. If you can do this, then you are half way there because you already feel great! You will raise your vibration closer to the vibration of your dreams. You will be confident and more positive, which makes you able to take inspired action that make your dreams come true!\r\n\r\n## 3. Make Every Step Fun\r\n\r\nSo many of us have been taught that with enough hard work anything is possible. But this idea leaves out something very important: the people who truly reach their dreams, especially in the biggest ways, have fun along the way. If you do what feels good then you will feel happier. When you feel happier, you are more inspired. Find what makes you feel good and focus on it, because feeling happy and inspired every step of the way is key. As you let go of the old belief that success has to be hard, you see life becomes happier and easier. You won’t need will power because you are driven with happy inspiration and you will be excited to get the next step of your work done! As you make fun and happiness a priority, you will notice wonderful shifts, and creating your dreams in very big ways will become easier than you were ever led to believe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4. Break Down Your Plans Into Little Pieces\r\n\r\nBig dreams can be quite overwhelming in the early days. There is usually so much work to be done it can be overwhelming! By breaking it down into little pieces, you avoid becoming derailed before you even begin. Grab a pen or your computer and write down your desire. Then write what needs to be done. These are your topics. Once you have your list of topics, go another step further and break them down again. These little sub-headings are the tasks that need to be completed. For instance, if you are wanting to publish a book, a topic might be to ‘Find cover art’. The tasks might be to come up with concept, contact illustrators, send them samples of your writing, etc. Each one of these tasks is little. Even if you only do one or two a day, you can feel positive that you are going in the right direction step by step.\r\n\r\n## 5. Don’t Listen To Negative People\r\n\r\nOften when positive people have big dreams, others will try to pull them down. They might warn you and say you’re wasting your time or there won’t be any jobs. The same old story, really. People have been holding themselves back because they don’t believe in themselves. Don’t to listen to them! If you feel in your heart your dream is possible and you want to achieve it – then you CAN have it. Remember, the universe has limitless abundance available for all. It will always deliver to those who believe in their dream so much they feel it before it physically exists. This is a fundamental principal in Law of Attraction. Keep your dream alive and don’t listen to those who think it can’t be done. There are clearly hundreds and thousands of examples of people succeeding and making their dreams happen, seemingly against all odds. These are the people you want to be listening to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 6. Find Wise Help and Loving Support\r\n\r\nOn the flipside, you want advice, support and help from strong, positive people whom you admire. Surround yourself with friends, mentors and teachers who believe in the power of positivity. You are the sum of the people you hang out with. So choose those who believe in you and in themselves. Find wise help and support from people who have already succeeded and make friends who are clearly already on their way. You will know, because they find their dreams and goals fun! They are inspired to wake up and work towards their dream life. They lift you up and listen to your plans. They only give constructive feedback and will always tell you it can be done! Leaving old friends behind can be hard, but if you are going in a different direction and wanting to be the best you can be, you will naturally begin to make new friends who have the same ideals, goals and positive focus as you do.\r\n\r\n## 7. Take Necessary Risks That Feel Right\r\n\r\nTake risks that feel right! There will be some times when you’re not sure what to do. Sometimes you need to take a big risk to move forward. You may need to move to a new city and leave an old life behind, or perhaps you might go into a business venture that could make or break you. There will be risks along the way, but it’s important to only choose risks that feel good. The risks that will lead you in the right direction will feel special. There will be something about it that lifts you up. Your heart will urge you to move forward and say “Yes!”. You will feel light, and whenever you visualize your future, the outcome will be completely positive and look and feel good. Take care to note if you have conflicting warnings in your gut or your imagination takes you down a negative path — this might not be the right risk for you. So when an opportunity feels good and comes to you from a good place with good people, then even if it is risky, seize it because it might just be the next logical step to jump forward towards your dream life!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou deserve to reach your dreams and you deserve to feel good. If you agree, please share with a friend who you believe in too."},"1b62":function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.d(t,"d",(function(){return s})),o.d(t,"c",(function(){return d})),o.d(t,"a",(function(){return

Companies have to come up with new business models to survive, new ideas, new products, new services and often have to twist their head to come up with new solutions. Job seekers, employers and deception makers have seen a quite big change in how to approach their market and how they get approached from the results of other people thinking outside the box.\r\n\r\nThe term "thinking outside the box" is is bit cliche, but when innovators talk about thinking outside the box, they mean coming up with creative ways to solve problems - new ways to look at things. How do they do it? How can you do it too? We first have to ask what the "box" is. Then we can look at how to get outside of it.\r\n\r\nThe "box" is the normal way of doing things and looking at things. It is the assumptions that almost everyone involved is making. The best way to start thinking out of the box then, is to identify and challenge all the assumptions that make up thinking inside the box.\r\n\r\nOne of the major liquor brands was faltering years ago, and they couldn\'t seem to boost their sales. Promotions, lowering the price, getting better shelf placement - these were the "in the box" solutions. Then someone challenged the assumptions, by asking "What if we stopped the promotions and just raised the price?"\r\n\r\nThe price was raised as an experiment, and sales soon doubled. As it turns out, some types of liquor are bought quite often as gifts. Buyers don\'t want to buy the most expensive one, but they also don\'t want to seem cheap, so they won\'t buy products that don\'t cost enough. Now imagine what happens to your profit margins when you raise the price and double the sales. That\'s the power of thinking outside of the box.\r\n\r\n###  \r\n\r\n### Ways To Get Outside The Box\r\n\r\nChallenging assumptions is a powerful creative problem solving technique. The difficult part is to identify the assumptions. If you are designing a new motorcycle, write down assumptions like "speed matters," "it has to run on gas" and "it needs two wheels," not because you expect to prove these wrong, but because challenging these can lead to creative possibilities. Maybe the time has come for an electric three-wheeled motorcycle.\r\n\r\nAnother way to get to creative solutions is to "assume the absurd." This is either fun or annoying, depending on how open-minded you can be. All you do is start making absurd assumptions, then finding ways to make sense of them. The easiest way to do it is by asking "what if."\r\n\r\nWhat if a carpet cleaning business was better off with half as many customers? It seems absurd, but work with it. Hmm...less stressful, perhaps. More profitable if each customer was worth three times as much. Is that possible? Commercial jobs that involve large easy-to-clean spaces (theaters, offices, convention halls) make more money in a day than houses, with fewer headaches. Focusing on getting those accounts could be the most profitable way to go - not so absurd.\r\n\r\nAnother way to more innovative ideas is to literally do your thinking out of the box. Get out of the house or the office. Look around at how others are doing things. On busses in Ecuador, salesmen put a product into everyones hands and let them hold it while they do a sales pitch. Then you have to give back "your" product or pay for it. It is very effective. How could you use the principle in your business?'},"535e":function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.r(t),t["default"]="## Meg Jay : Essential questions to ask your future self\r\n\r\n#### \r\n\r\n00:00\r\n\r\nMeg Jay: We need to talk about the empathy gap. So the empathy gap is why we sometimes hate on people on the other end of the political spectrum. Or it's why maybe we shrug their shoulders at the problems of those who look different or live different or love different than we do. It's why we almost certainly aren't doing enough to protect our kids and grandkids from climate change. It can just be difficult sometimes to care about people that we don't know or to do right by people who don't even exist yet. But what if I told you that that same empathy gap can also get in the way of us doing right by ourselves in our 20s and beyond? And before I go on, let me say that everything I'm about to talk about also applies to all of us out there who are well beyond our 20s. \r\n\r\n00:49\r\n\r\nBut for a little bit of background, in 2013, I gave a talk about why our twenties matter. So it's about almost 10 years later. I'm still a clinical psychologist who specializes in 20-somethings. But these days, the 20-somethings I see, they know their 20s matter. So they want to get them right. They want to move to the right city. They want to take the right job. They want to find the right partner. They want to have the right answers. Well, the bad news is there are no right answers. There are no right answers for where you should live or where you should work or how you should settle down. These are what are called \"large world problems\" because there are just too many unknowns. No app, no algorithm, no enneagram can ever solve these problems or answer these questions for you. \r\n\r\n01:37\r\n\r\nBut the good news is, because there are no right answers, there are no wrong answers. There are only your answers. So your 20s are a great time to listen to and be honest with yourself. They're a great time to have a conversation with your future self. So philosopher Derek Parfit said we neglect our future selves because of some sort of failure of belief or imagination. So I'm going to say that again, because it's really important: we neglect our future selves because of some sort of failure of belief or imagination. So when you're young, it can be difficult to imagine or believe that you could ever really be 35, especially when most of the influencers you see on Instagram or TikTok are younger than that. But that's a problem because research shows that our brains think about our future selves similarly to how they think about strangers. And that's where the empathy gap comes in. It can be difficult for us to care about a version of ourselves that we haven't met yet. \r\n\r\n02:44\r\n\r\nYet research also shows that if we find a way to close that empathy gap between our present selves and our future selves, we start to think more about what we could do now to be kind to ourselves down the line. So in one of my favorite studies on this, researchers used virtual reality to show 20-somethings what they would look like when they're old. Scary, I know, but the 20-somethings who saw their age-morphed selves, set aside more money towards retirement than those who didn't. So I don't have virtual reality in my office and saving for retirement isn't something that comes up a whole lot. But what does come up a whole lot is that about 85 percent of life's most defining moments take place by around age 35. So I ask my clients to imagine themselves at age 35 and I ask them to believe in their ability to have created those defining moments. And then I ask them to get really specific about what they see. What do I look like, where do I live, what do I do for work? Do I enjoy the work? Is it meaningful? Is it important? Does it pay well? Might these things be true one day? Which of these things do I really care about? What about after work? Who do I come home to? Do I have a partner? What does that relationship look like? How does it look different or similar to the ones that I saw growing up? Are there kids in the picture? How old was I when I had my first child? How old might I be when that child goes to college or has their own kids? And of course, am I happy, am I healthy? And what exactly do I do or not do that makes me happy and healthy? \r\n\r\n04:38\r\n\r\nSo the idea here is just to try to get to know your future self, because when we spend time connecting with that person, we do some reverse engineering and we start to ask our present self questions about how our present and our future can come together or meet somewhere in the middle, along the way. We start to ask questions like, \"How is everything I think I want going to fit?\" or \"What does all this mean about what I need to be doing now?\" Or here's one of my favorite questions to ask yourself at any age: \"If I'm in a job or a relationship or a situation I would like not to be in in five years, then how much longer am I going to spend on this?\" So, like I said, many of these are tough questions. But 20 years of doing this work has taught me that 20-somethings aren't afraid of being asked the tough questions. What they're really afraid of is not being asked the tough questions. And maybe that's because they've told the world that they're interested in having courageous conversations about race and class and politics and the environment. And perhaps at any age, one of the most courageous conversations you can have is with your future self. Thank you. \r\n\r\n05:54\r\n\r\nWhitney Pennington Rodgers: Thank you so much, Meg. That was wonderful. I'm glad to be here with you and with all of our members. And I know that your work is with people in their 20s, young adults. But you mentioned in your talk that this is something you can apply at any stage of your life and at any point. It's not just advice that you should use in your 20s, is that right? \r\n\r\n06:14\r\n\r\nMJ: Oh, yes. I mean, I think our 20s is when we first start having to sort of figure out, \"Oh, there's a future self out there. And I guess I better think about that person.\" Because, you know, like, school kind of does it for us, has us plot two or three years in advance. So our 20s are when we first start to think across those horizons. We get better at it over time. And then in our 30s, 40s, 50s, we have more built-in connections to the future. Like maybe if you have kids, you think, \"Hey, I really want to be around when they graduate from college\" or whatever the case may be. So there are there are ways we kind of -- it becomes a little bit more natural the older that you get. But it's always important. I have a couple in my practice right now and they're actually having a conversation with their future relationship, because in about five years, their kids are going to be leaving for college and they want to be sure they have a marriage they feel good about when the kids are gone. Or if I think about myself, I'm 51. So I'm having a conversation with my future self about, \"Hey, you know, what do I want to get out of the years of my career that are just ahead in my 50s and, you know, time's running out. What is it I want to get done?\" So I think we're, you know, we always need to be in conversation with our future self. It's just something that's new and usually quite difficult for 20-somethings. \r\n\r\n07:38\r\n\r\nWPR: So I guess one thing I’m curious about is, you know, people have said, \"OK, I like this idea of these questions. I want to ask myself these questions.\" And they do that. And then what happens? You know, I guess, what do you recommend people do next? What is the way that they can sort of take this further to advance themselves and this thinking? \r\n\r\n07:58\r\n\r\nMJ: Yeah, so, you know, again, it depends on the goal or what ended up happening between you and your future self in this conversation. But I think like most long-form projects, so I would suggest some, you know, pencil and paper, do some math, sort of sketch out some things just to start with. And then as you go along, you might realize other things that are important to you down the line that you want to be sure that you get in there and add in there. And then I would figure out -- it depends on what it is, but a schedule that works for you, where you check in about your progress on, \"Hey, am I being true to myself and to my future self in terms of what I said I was going to start prioritizing more.\" So maybe that check-in is once a month. Maybe it's every year on New Year's. Maybe it's your birthday. It really kind of depends. But I do think -- I mean, having this conversation one time because you heard my chat today and then dropping it is probably not going to do a lot for you. But if it's kind of the beginning of an ongoing conversation with yourself and like with any goal, it's probably something we need to keep circling back around on. \"OK? Is this still what I want and how am I doing on this?\" It kind of create some accountability. And so for that, that is where I think some people find, I'm going to tell a friend or I'm going to tell my pastor or I'm going to write it in my journal or whatever it is for you to kind of say, this is a goal that I'm going to own and I'm going to keep coming back to it. \r\n\r\n09:36\r\n\r\nWPR: Have some sort of partner, even if that partner is yourself, your future self. \r\n\r\n09:42\r\n\r\nMJ: Right. \r\n\r\n09:43\r\n\r\nWPR: Well, Meg, thank you so much for being with us today, for your for your talk and for sharing so much of your wisdom around these questions and your 20s, and so much more. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. \r\n\r\n09:55\r\n\r\nMJ: Yeah, my pleasure. It was really fun. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**梅格·杰:问未来的自己一些基本问题**\r\n\r\n \r\n 00：00 \r\n 梅格·杰:我们需要谈谈同理心缺口。同理心缺口就是为什么我们有时讨厌政治光谱另一端的人。或者这就是为什么我们对那些和我们长相不同，生活不同，爱不同的人的问题耸耸肩。这就是为什么我们几乎肯定没有做足够的工作来保护我们的孩子和孙辈免受气候变化的影响。有时候我们很难去关心那些我们不认识的人或者为那些还不存在的人做正确的事。但如果我告诉你，同样的同理心差距也会妨碍我们在20多岁甚至更大的时候做正确的事情，你会怎么想?在我继续之前，我想说，我将要讲的所有内容也适用于我们所有20多岁的人。 \r\n 00：49 \r\n 但是为了了解一点背景，在2013年，我做了一个关于为什么20多岁很重要的演讲。大概是10年之后。我还是个临床心理学家专门研究20多岁的人。但现在，我看到的20多岁的年轻人，他们知道20多岁很重要。所以他们想要正确的。他们想搬到正确的城市。他们想要接受合适的工作。他们想要找到合适的伴侣。他们想要正确的答案。坏消息是没有正确答案。对于你应该在哪里生活，在哪里工作，如何安定下来，没有正确的答案。这就是所谓的“世界大问题”，因为有太多的未知数。没有应用程序，没有算法，没有九形图能够解决这些问题，或者为你回答这些问题。 \r\n 01:37 \r\n 但好消息是，因为没有正确答案，所以也就没有错误答案。只有你自己的答案。所以20多岁是倾听和诚实面对自己的好时机。这是和未来的自己交谈的好时机。哲学家德里克·帕菲特(Derek Parfit)说，我们忽视未来的自己，是因为某种信念或想象的失败。所以我要再说一遍，因为这真的很重要:我们忽视了未来的自己，因为某种信仰或想象的失败。所以，当你还年轻的时候，很难想象或相信你真的能到35岁，尤其是当你在Instagram或TikTok上看到的大多数影响者都还不到35岁。但这是个问题，因为研究表明，我们的大脑对未来的自我的思考方式与他们对陌生人的思考方式相似。这就是同理心缺口的由来。对我们来说，去关心一个我们还没见过的自己是很困难的。 \r\n 02:44 \r\n 然而，研究也表明，如果我们找到一种方法来缩小现在的自己和未来的自己之间的同理心差距，我们就会开始更多地思考我们现在可以做些什么来善待自己。在我最喜欢的一项研究中，研究人员使用虚拟现实向20多岁的人展示他们年老时的样子。我知道这很可怕，但20多岁的人看到自己的年龄变化后，会比那些没有看到的人为退休留出更多的钱。所以我的办公室里没有虚拟现实设备，为退休储蓄也不是经常发生的事情。但经常发生的是，大约85%的人生最重要的时刻发生在35岁左右。所以我让我的客户想象自己在35岁的时候，我让他们相信自己有能力创造那些决定性的时刻。然后我让他们非常具体地描述他们看到的东西。我长什么样，我住在哪里，我做什么工作?我喜欢这份工作吗?它是有意义的吗?它是重要的?薪水高吗?这些事情有一天会成真吗?我真正关心的是什么?什么 \r\n 下班后呢?我回家是为了谁?我有搭档吗?这种关系是什么样的?它和我成长过程中看到的有什么不同或相似之处?照片里有孩子吗?我第一个孩子是几岁?等孩子上大学或有自己的孩子时，我可能几岁?当然，我快乐吗，健康吗?到底做什么或不做什么能让我快乐和健康? \r\n 04:38 \r\n 所以这里的想法只是试图了解未来的自己,因为当我们花时间联系那个人,我们做一些逆向工程开始问我们现在的自我问题关于我们的现在与将来可以一起或满足中间,。我们开始问这样的问题:“我认为我想要做的事情怎么样?”或者“这些对我现在需要做的事情意味着什么?”或者，这是我最喜欢问自己的问题之一，无论在任何年龄:“如果我正在从事一份工作、一段感情或一种我五年内不想从事的情况，那么我还要在这上面再花多长时间?”所以，就像我说的，很多问题都很棘手。但20年的工作经验告诉我，20多岁的人并不害怕被问到棘手的问题。他们真正害怕的是没有被问到棘手的问题。也许这是因为他们告诉世界，他们有兴趣就种族、阶级、政治和环境进行勇敢的对话。也许在任何年龄，你能和未来的自己进行的最勇敢的对话之一。谢谢你！ \r\n 05:54 \r\n 惠特尼·潘宁顿·罗杰斯:非常感谢，梅格。这是美妙的。我很高兴在这里与你和我们所有的成员在一起。我知道你的工作对象是20多岁的年轻人。但是你在你的演讲中提到这是你可以在人生的任何阶段和任何时刻用到的东西。这不仅仅是你应该在20多岁时使用的建议，对吗? \r\n 06:14 \r\n 答:哦,是的。我的意思是，我认为20多岁是我们第一次开始思考，“哦，未来的自己就在那里。”我想我最好想想那个人。”因为，你知道，就像学校为我们做的，让我们提前两三年计划。所以我们在20多岁的时候开始思考这些问题。随着时间的推移，我们会做得更好。然后在我们30多岁，40多岁，50多岁的时候，我们与未来有了更多的内在联系。比如，如果你有孩子，你会想，“嘿，他们大学毕业时我真的想在他们身边”或其他情况。所以有。有一些方法。随着年龄的增长它会变得更自然。但这总是很重要的。现在我有一些实践,他们实际上有一个对话与未来的关系,因为在五年内,他们的孩子要离开大学,他们想要确保他们的婚姻感觉良好时,孩子们已经一去不复返了。再想想我自己，我51岁了。所以我在和未来的自己对话，“嘿，你知道，我想从我50多岁的职业生涯中得到什么，你知道，时间已经不多了。我想做什么?”所以我认为我们，你知道，我们总是需要和未来的自己对话。对于20多岁的年轻人来说，这是一种全新的体验，而且通常是相当困难的。 \r\n 07:38 \r\n WPR:我想我很好奇的一件事是，你知道，人们说，“好吧，我喜欢这些问题的想法。我想问自己这些问题。”他们就是这么做的。然后呢?你知道，我猜，你建议人们接下来做什么?他们是如何进一步提升自己和这种思想的? \r\n 07:58 \r\n MJ:对，这要取决于你的目标，或者你和未来的自己在谈话中最后发生了什么。但我认为像大多数长期项目一样，我会建议用铅笔和纸，做一些数学计算，从草图开始。然后随着你的学习，你可能会意识到其他对你很重要的东西你想要确保你在这里添加了这些东西。然后我会找到,这取决于它是什么,但适合你的时间表,你检查你的进展,“嘿,我是不是真的对自己和未来的自己而言,我说我要开始优先。”所以可能是一个月一次。也许是每年的新年。也许今天是你的生日。这要看情况而定。但我确实认为——我的意思是，有一次因为你听到了我今天的谈话而进行这样的对话，然后放弃它可能不会对你有多大帮助。但如果这是一种与自己的持续对话的开始，就像任何目标一样，它可能是我们需要继续绕回来的东西。”好吗?这仍然是我想要的吗?我该怎么做?”这就产生了一些责任。所以,这就是我认为有些人觉得,我要告诉一个朋友或我要告诉我的牧师或我要把它写在我的日记之类的对你说,这是一个目标,我将自己和我将继续回到它。 \r\n 09:36 \r\n WPR:找一个伴侣，即使那个伴侣是你自己，你未来的自己。09:42 \r\n 答:对的。 \r\n 09：43 \r\n WPR:梅格，非常感谢你今天和我们在一起，感谢你的演讲，感谢你在这些问题和你20多岁的时候分享你的智慧，以及更多。谢谢你！谢谢你！谢谢你！ \r\n 09:55 \r\n MJ:是的，我很乐意。真的很有趣。 "},bd51:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.r(t),t["default"]="# 50 of world's richest entrepreneur’s priceless advice\r\n\r\naking advice from people who had success in the fields you want to succeed in, can often be a good habit to have.

If you make goals without asking yourself what your true strengths and values are first, you could put yourself on the fast track to disappointment. On the other hand, if you don’t set any intentions at all, you could bounce through life like a pinball doing what others want without accomplishing what’s really important to *you*.\r\n\r\nFear not. Here are 8 powerful ways to be goal-oriented using the **ENVISION method** (**E**ndgame – **N**esting – **V**alue – **I**nspiration – **S**uperpowers – **I**ntimates – **O**penness – **N**ourishment) that will help you create a successful, meaningful life:\r\n\r\n## 1. Start With the End in Mind\r\n\r\nTo ensure that you make goals that matter, stand back and examine your life from a broader perspective. Think about the happy ending you would like to achieve, the “E” in ENVISION, and work backwards to determine how you’ll get there.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you’d like to generate goals for yourself over the next five years, write down where you’d like to be professionally and personally five years from now.\r\n\r\n*Where do you see yourself in relation to work? What’s your family life like? What type of friends and social support group do you have? What are your hobbies?* \r\n\r\nNext, ask yourself where you would like to be one year from now relative to what you’d like to accomplish in five years. Write the answer out in enough detail so that it seems real to you. Then, ask yourself where you’d like to be three months from now. Be specific.\r\n\r\n*What about one month or one week? What one small action could you take this week to come closer to achieving your master plan?*\r\n\r\nThis exercise is a fun and eye-opening way to line up your goals with the bigger picture of your life so that you won’t waste your precious time on passing fancies and other people’s agendas.\r\n\r\n## 2. Create Nested Goals\r\n\r\nThe most efficient way to achieve your goals is to nest action items inside them, the first “N” in ENVISION. Goal-oriented people[ get specific](https://www.lifehack.org/759949/how-to-use-smart-goal) about when, where, and how they’ll reach their objectives by breaking them down into sub-goals.\r\n\r\nMake your aspirations challenging but not too hard. Each one should be measurable. Instead of writing “I’d like to write a book,” try setting an intention such as “I’d like to write two hours a day, four times a week” and mark space on your calendar for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMake your aims positive and keep track of your progress. Instead of business goals like “I’d like to quit my stinking job,” think about what a desirable career would look like. Try “I’d like to develop educational toys with like-minded people in a virtual office,” and then send out your résumé to companies with matching job openings.\r\n\r\nCome up with alternative pathways to your goals so that if one doesn’t work, you’ll already have plan B in place. It’s normal to fail and experience setbacks. This goal-oriented strategy will help you move forward on the pathway to your dreams no matter what happens.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more on creating effectively goals here:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n## 3. Get Clear on Your Values\r\n\r\nBefore you start setting goals, it’s important to ask yourself what you really value, the “V” in ENVISION.\r\n\r\nThe [number one regret of people](https://www.amazon.com/dp/140194065X?tag=s7621-20) on their deathbed is that they did not live their dreams. Don’t let that be you. To avoid living a life full of “shoulds” and obligations, make a wish list. Jot down what you really want, and put all the reasons you think you can’t have it aside.\r\n\r\nThese aspirations can range from the material (such as a new car) to the psychological (high self-worth), to the spiritual (inner peace), to pretty much anything you can think of. What kind of life would be music to your ears? It doesn’t matter whether it seems unattainable or even downright crazy.\r\n\r\nGiving yourself permission to daydream about a rich and fulfilling life is the first step to getting it. Be sure your goals speak to your soul.\r\n\r\n## 4. Make Time for Inspiration\r\n\r\nAs you put your goals together, think about how you can find downtime to become goal-driven and receive inspiration in your life, the first “I” in ENVISION.\r\n\r\nAmericans put in the longest work hours and get the shortest paid vacation time in the developed world. Those of us “lucky” enough to have jobs have added another day to our work week because we now check work emails and calls from home. It’s easy to see why it’s hard to stay motivated toward specific goals in the long-term. \r\n\r\nHowever, the second regret of the dying is that they wished they didn’t work so hard. Research shows that people who engage in creative hobbies and side projects are happier and flourish more in life because they can generate new ideas and express themselves uniquely.[1] Feeling energized and playful, they get more done in less time, become better problem solvers, and receive better evaluations at work.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n####  \r\n\r\n## 5. Form Goals Around Your Superpowers\r\n\r\nResearch shows that people are more likely to succeed when they develop their natural strengths, the “S” in ENVISION, than work on their weaknesses.\r\n\r\nYou can find your superpowers by answering these [questions](https://www.lifehack.org/301920/10-questions-help-you-find-and-boost-your-superpowers).\r\n\r\nEach of us has a unique purpose in life. Most of us don’t realize it, though, because we’ve been pressured to conform to someone else’s idea of who we should be. [Fear of change](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/change-the-way-you-see-fear-and-change-your-life.html) and [staying in our comfort zones](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/this-what-happens-when-you-move-out-your-comfort-zone.html) stunts our growth. Stretch yourself and take a risk if you want to find out what makes your heart sing.\r\n\r\nMake an action plan to create a life in which you express your superpowers on a regular basis, whether it be through your vocation, a meaningful side project, a worthy cause, mindful parenting, volunteer work, or whatever else sparks your interest. This goal-oriented strategy guarantees you’ll thrive at work and at home.\r\n\r\n## 6. Make Time for Intimates\r\n\r\nWhen setting your goals, be sure to carve out time for your intimates, the second “I” in ENVISION. Intimates refers to close friends or people you have close relationships with.\r\n\r\nThe fourth regret of the dying is that they were too busy to see their friends much.[3] Make it a point to connect with *real* friends, people you can turn to for sympathy when you need it, confide in about most things, and be your true self around.\r\n\r\nA new Cigna study shows that nearly half of Americans feel alone or left out.[4] According to Dr. Julianne Holt-Lunstad at Brigham Young University, the detrimental effects of loneliness is the same as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.[5] She warns that:\r\n\r\n> “Loneliness and social isolation are linked to around a 30 percent increased risk of having a stroke or developing coronary artery disease.”[6]\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBeing with your friends is not only good for your soul, but it is also essential for your health and well-being[7]. Put it in your goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 7. Open up Emotionally\r\n\r\nWhen crafting your goal-oriented life, be sure to include ways you can open up about your feelings, the “O” in ENVISION. The third regret of the dying is that they wish they’d had the courage to express their true feelings instead of stuffing their emotions down to keep peace with others.\r\n\r\nTo lead a fulfilling life, it’s important to prioritize talking and behaving honestly with others instead of hiding your true feelings. According to Dr. Leslie Becker-Phelps[8]:\r\n\r\n> “Start with identifying your emotions (e.g. angry, hurt) and understanding what triggered you to feel this way.”\r\n\r\nShe recommends you try to understand your feelings and practice self-compassion for having them. When you’re calmer, try to understand the person who upset you. This will help you respect and care about yourself and the other person.\r\n\r\nIf there is someone you need to talk to or a situation you’d like to resolve, honor your feelings. Whether it be writing a letter, making a phone call, or visiting someone you haven’t seen in years, put it on your goal list.\r\n\r\nBe sure to meet in a safe environment if you’re confronting someone who has abused or harmed you. Tell the truth as you see it, and try to be kind.\r\n\r\nSharing your genuine feelings may bring you closer together, and it may not. It doesn’t really matter how the other person responds. What matters is that you expressed your true self. Make emotional honesty a habit by adding it to your goals.\r\n\r\n## 8. Nurture Happiness\r\n\r\nTo be more goal-oriented and succeed in life, nurture the people and activities that bring you joy, the final “N” in ENVISION.\r\n\r\nThe fifth regret of people on their deathbed is that they wished they’d let themselves be happier. Instead, they stayed stuck in old patterns and pretended to be content when they weren’t.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t like your job, make it a goal to look for a new position that aligns your paycheck with your purpose. If you are entrepreneurially-minded, think about turning your passion project into a business you love. If you have multiple passions, consider pursuing a slash career (e.g., copywriter/coder/career coach).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to *Forbes Magazine*, many companies are beginning to see the value in hiring employees who have side gigs that differ from their main vocations. You’ll bring in multiple streams of income and experience more meaning and fulfillment in your life.[9]\r\n\r\nIf you are unhappy with your marriage or romantic relationship, [set a goal](https://www.lifehack.org/808733/marriage-goals) to do something about it. Do you need to go to counseling? Do you need to move on?\r\n\r\nIf you’re on the fence about whether to keep a friend in your life, be goal-oriented about getting closure on the issue. Take care of yourself in the process by completing positive daily tasks, like taking yoga classes or getting a much-needed massage.\r\n\r\nWhatever you do, make it a goal to show compassion as often as you can because it will boost your happiness.[10] By helping others in need, you not only can decrease their suffering, but you can also make yourself happier than you could by directly pursuing activities to make you happy.\r\n\r\n## Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nIn summary, the ENVISION method shows you how to blend lessons from the five regrets of the dying with effective [goal-setting](https://www.lifehack.org/874351/goal-setting) techniques that center around your strengths to become goal-driven.\r\n\r\nIt may seem like a lot of work at first glance, but, in truth, it should only take you about an hour to piece together a list of goals following these guidelines. Why not trade an hour of watching television or engaging in social media to do this instead? You can always get online and watch TV later to reward yourself for becoming more goal-oriented.\r\n\r\nYou’ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain by exploring what would make your heart sing. It’s worth investing in yourself this way. You have the power to create a life that totally rocks by setting the intention to do so. As the 13th-century Persian poet Rumi wrote,\r\n\r\n> “What you seek is seeking you.”\r\n"},e001:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.r(t),t["default"]='# How to reach your dreams - 5 simple steps\r\n\r\nPeople tell you to follow your dream, become something, achieve something. The cultural norms and expectations in the society that you live in, most likely have what you see as your dream figured out for you. You maybe wouldn\'t come in here and read if you already figured out things, and already enjoy you dream life.\r\n\r\nYou can maybe identify typical questions where the aim is to measure your success rate. They pop up in most social settings, some cultures define them as rude. So they have to be packed in with a vague approach. While other cultures allow more direct aimed questions, and approaches to analyse your success.\r\n\r\nWe get information in all directions on how to find success, and what is successful. But what people often forget to tell you: What real success actually is. Real success can only be defined and achieved by you. What you need to remember is that success is relative, there is no universal understanding of what success is.\r\n\r\nI know people from different parts of the world, many successful in ways that are defined by the society they live in. Where ever I go, I see so many clearly defined success criteria. People I would say are clearly identified as intelligent by most people. I observe following blindly norms, even the obviousness that this will not lead them anywhere near success in they would define for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe world today offers more possibilities, than ever before to be able to follow your dream. Where the world is full of possibilities in all directions, for those who face their fear, leave their comfort zone, grabs the opportunity to reach their dreams, and create their own story.\r\n\r\nWe live in a time where entrepreneurship is encouraged and supported by almost everyone, everywhere. Governments encourage, teachers are willing, possibilities for learning and developing your talent. Learning skills, and concepts has never been more available. The demand for exceptional skills, skill combinations and various competences have never been greater. And the possibilities to perform these skills anywhere in the world is increasingly present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## **So how this fit together?**\r\n\r\nAs you maybe have understood in the direction of the article so far. In todays efficient driven economy, the achievement drive is fuelled according to goals others have placed for you. Your parents, society, the education system, your friends, anyone you talk to in a society you live in will remind you on these fixed success criteria.\r\n\r\nThose goals and values, are often what most of us think is what the future will bring. Even these goals towards a defined success are not your own goals. The reality is thats not how the future should or possibly will be.\r\n\r\nReaching goals other people placed for you is no certainty either. The future will demand skills, and talent at a higher level than today. The way of becoming a talent, and a skilled person is to have a passion for what you do. To love it…. to follow your dream. So by following your dream… the chances are probably that you will have a greater success in the future if you do things right. Makes sense?...\r\n\r\n> Reaching goals other people placed for you is no certainty either. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## **5 simple steps to reach your dream**\r\n\r\nOk, so you understood my point so far? You define your success. So the next step: Most people get the impression that your dream, or own success definition will come screaming in your face. "This is who you are, this is who you will be !!!".... This is rarely the case for most of us. Your dreams has a tendency to come sneaking on you, is shapes slowly depending on the input you fill your mind with. And it whispers in your ear……listening to this voice can change your life.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\'t matter what happens, think of it as a steady process. Many struggle and "hawk" around. Just slow down, and enjoy the process. Life is too short. There might be things that happens in life that forces you to put your life on hold, find the passion that will keep you on track. Learn how to cope with it.\r\n\r\n**Step 1: Create habits**\r\n\r\nHabits, the way of creating your own reality. There are people that have the ability to follow the habits towards their goals, no matter what…. But remember being constantly buzzy does not mean that you will be successful. Take your time to observe your surroundings, and work smart not hard. \r\n\r\nA small bush grow into a three, but this does not happened over night, its the result of habits of smart work over a long period of time towards a conscious goal.\r\n\r\nIf reaching your goals includes getting a certain skill set, create habits towards that goal. And again… remember things will take time. Nothing is done within a day. If that skill set towards your dream includes getting an academic, or technical degree. Identify and create goals towards getting that degree, and create the smart habits towards accomplishing that specific goal in the process.\r\n\r\nAnd remember if that degree is a part of your dream, the degree is only one milestone in reaching that dream. An academic degree and/ or skill sets you learned will in itself will never alone get you anywhere.\r\n\r\nDont rush the process, enjoy the process while it last. Success takes time. It takes 30 years to get 30 years, you can’t rush that process. The same applies for success as a process.\r\n\r\n**Step 2: Find your environment**\r\n\r\nWhat matters is now… this moment. Se the now, take responsibility and move forward. Finding your environment is essential. People strive for happiness, and many would argue that happiness correlates strongly with progress in individual values. \r\n\r\nThe world is filled with unhappy, and unsuccessful people that often strive for values that society has planned for them. Values that rarely overlaps with their own values and dreams. Many can even be materially rich, have a comfortable lifestyle and have the specific factors that many see as success in todays achiever society. All this without being successful at all…. , and most importantly they often dont feel happy or successful at all. Create your own path, create your own environment.\r\n\r\nTest your imagination to find your environment, to develop your knowledge, skill sets, passion and a platform of things, that will push you towards good habits in the direction of your dreams. An environment can be the people you hang out with, maybe people you have to change. It can be your physical location. It can even be where you find, and have access to information. It can be your own thoughts, and you mindset. See your environment as the collection of the stuff that makes up your surroundings, all the stuff that influences you.\r\n\r\nThe habits you create in step 1, should be aligned not only with productive habits within your environment to reach smart goals. But also create habits to constantly seek environments that are good for you.\r\n\r\n**Step 3. Dont make excuses**\r\n\r\n"Thats in my future", "ill do that in the future"." I see what I have to do to reach my goals, but that will be for another time".\r\n\r\nIt\'s no certainty that you will have the possibility to follow your dream in the future. Life has its ways of making no guarantees. So create those habits towards your dream, and be the part of the environment that grows in your direction already today.\r\n\r\nTalk and think from a perspective, you are not a CEO, a HR manager, a recruiter, a consultant, an accountant, or an intern. Talk from the perspective of what you do. what your goals are, not your title that someone else have given you.\r\n\r\nSit down and think about what you have today. and what you can do to reach the goal. \r\n\r\nSuccess is done by creating superior effort, and focused execution. Dicipline and consistency towards your goal is the key. So once you have found that direction, don\'t make excuses towards maintaining those habits.\r\n\r\nIt is not a great effort if you manage to make these habits a part of the environment that makes you. This is your passion by then, be true to your passion. Remember, if you make excuses a part of your habits and environment. It becomes a part of you. Excuses are nothing else than uncertainty, this is an uncertainty you should fight.\r\n\r\n**Step 4. Accept failure**\r\n\r\nLife will always have ups and downs, accept that as a fact of the reality you live in. And it is important to remember that it is in your downs that you learn. Create habits of learning at the max potential from your mistakes, fail fast and recover fast. \r\n\r\nDont congratulate yourself to much, or regret yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody elses. Remember that failure is just a part of a set of chances. By learning from failures you reduce the chances for similar failures to happened again, and open your mind for growth and development.\r\n\r\nDont feel guilty if you don\'t know what to do with your life. Most people I meet don\'t know what they want to do with their life. Some of the most interesting people i have meet still also dont.\r\n\r\nThe fear of having a dream, and failing at it is great in all of us. Just having a dream and accept failure as a process towards reaching your dream is the key.\r\n\r\nYou will fail, that is a certainty. But the key is how your perception of the failure as a resource is. How many times have you taught about something you want to do in your life, a dream that you have? And you talked yourself out of it….Remember, it is when you are uncomfortable in life you learn. So learn ways to include this in your environment, and be comfortable with it.\r\n\r\nDreams change, but finding meaning in life and finding the meaning in your life of who you are, will shape your dreams.\r\n\r\nSo keep in mind, your dreams are not static either. They will take shape with you, along with your environment and the habits that follow.\r\n\r\n**Step 5. Find meaning in life**\r\n\r\nThere is no prize out there. We grow up with motivational features, rewards and prices for accomplishments we do. Some get rewards for good grades, rewards in their work for good accomplishments. If you see the big picture, there are no prizes, there are no existing prize you will achieve, reach or stretch towards in life. \r\n\r\nThe only prize is the one you create for yourself. To want and to be ambitious is not enough, thats just a desire. To know what you want, and to achieve in that direction towards the values you care for… your dreams should be your goal.\r\n\r\nThis will enhance meaning in what you do. If all you do is running around and achieving goals, there is nothing more to it then that. The points of goals is to have some kind of sense, some kind of meaning. No one can live a life without a sense of meaning. You got to have a reason for what you do.\r\n\r\nIf you take your passion, and make it into something. When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change. By accepting that you get shaped by the habits within your environment, that align with your values. In that way, you are guided by the failures you do along the way within this environment.\r\n\r\nThis meaning in life does not only make it easier to find your dream and passion, and follow it. It makes it easier for you too self- regulate towards values, goals, success factors and finally dreams.\r\n\r\n## **Finally. So how do this add up as logical?**\r\n\r\nNo clear path on where to start? Well, I haven\'t mentioned that for obvious fact that there is no fixed solution. Then this article wouldn\'t be any less success defining, than any of the others in your current environment. Many maybe also influencing you on what success, values and dreams are.\r\n\r\nIf you dont know how to do it… that doesn’t have to mean that you can not learn. You dont have to be great to start….. But "you have to start to be great", that is a famous phrase many self development coaches uses. And it is true, start somewhere.\r\n\r\nIf you know your dreams, learn towards the goals to reach them. Develop yourself and on the way become yourself, get more attractive to others as a person, as a partner, as an employee, as a business partner or any other reason in the direction you want along with your self- development.\r\n\r\nIf you dont know your path, the same rules apply, follow the steps from 1 to 5, and seek to improve them. Learn…. start to learn. Find out who you are, learn more about yourself, your skills and your dreams.\r\n\r\nYou have maybe neglected, and forgotten yourself for a period time. Remember your dreams as a child, who were you then? Find what you love, love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet. keep looking. Dont be scared of closing your eyes and dream, that is what we all do.\r\n\r\nBut when you open your eyes you have to see the reality, that is what makes the difference in at least this setting. You have defined the goals along the way, what does it take to reach those goal, and the next ones? What do you have to do to reach those goals? Remember to occasionally also find, and write down the reasons for the goals. Are they aligned with what you try to achieve?\r\n\r\nRemember dreams without goals, remains dreams. Dreams without goals are just dreams. And they ultimately lead to your disappointment. Dreams can not be achieved without accomplishments towards a goal. \r\n\r\nSomewhere deep inside, you know what kind of person you were designed to be. You know your strength. If you know you are smart, that not enough. How are you smart? How can you use this towards your goals? Discover yourself, respect your nature, find and follow your dreams and…….Create your own story\r\n\r\nInvent yourself, and then reinvent yourself trough the steps….If the reinvention of you changes your dream one day, adapt to that. You can not expect your dreams to be the same, if you have adapted your values so much that you changed to another person.\r\n\r\nIts not about victories or losses in life, but truly about creating habits and a mental mindset towards continuous growth. The habits of success. \r\n\r\nAnd remember, we are who we choose to be.'},f7d7:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.r(t),t["default"]="## Meg Jay: Why 30 is not the new 20\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n00:04\r\n\r\nWhen I was in my 20s, I saw my very first psychotherapy client. I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley. She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex. \r\n\r\n00:17\r\n\r\nNow Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top, and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems. Now when I heard this, I was so relieved. My classmate got an arsonist for her first client. \r\n\r\n00:37\r\n\r\n(Laughter) \r\n\r\n00:39\r\n\r\nAnd I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys. This I thought I could handle. But I didn't handle it. With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session, it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road. \"Thirty's the new 20,\" Alex would say, and as far as I could tell, she was right. Work happened later, marriage happened later, kids happened later, even death happened later. Twentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time. \r\n\r\n01:12\r\n\r\nBut before long, my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life. I pushed back. I said, \"Sure, she's dating down, she's sleeping with a knucklehead, but it's not like she's going to marry the guy.\" And then my supervisor said, \"Not yet, but she might marry the next one. Besides, the best time to work on Alex's marriage is before she has one.\" \r\n\r\n01:41\r\n\r\nThat's what psychologists call an \"Aha!\" moment. That was the moment I realized, 30 is not the new 20. Yes, people settle down later than they used to, but that didn't make Alex's 20s a developmental downtime. That made Alex's 20s a developmental sweet spot, and we were sitting there, blowing it. That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem, and it had real consequences, not just for Alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere. \r\n\r\n02:19\r\n\r\nThere are 50 million twentysomethings in the United States right now. We're talking about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider that no one's getting through adulthood without going through their 20s first. \r\n\r\n02:34\r\n\r\n(Laughter) \r\n\r\n02:35\r\n\r\nRaise your hand if you're in your 20s. I really want to see some twentysomethings here. Oh, yay! You are all awesome. If you work with twentysomethings, you love a twentysomething, you're losing sleep over twentysomethings, I want to see — Okay. Awesome, twentysomethings really matter. \r\n\r\n02:52\r\n\r\nSo, I specialize in twentysomethings because I believe that every single one of those 50 million twentysomethings deserves to know what psychologists, sociologists, neurologists and fertility specialists already know: that claiming your 20s is one of the simplest, yet most transformative, things you can do for work, for love, for your happiness, maybe even for the world. \r\n\r\n03:20\r\n\r\nThis is not my opinion. These are the facts. We know that 80 percent of life's most defining moments take place by age 35. That means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experiences and \"Aha!\" moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid-30s. People who are over 40, don't panic. This crowd is going to be fine, I think. We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn. We know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30. We know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your 20s as it rewires itself for adulthood, which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself, now is the time to change it. We know that personality changes more during your 20s than at any other time in life, and we know that female fertility peaks at age 28, and things get tricky after age 35. So your 20s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options. \r\n\r\n04:36\r\n\r\nSo when we think about child development, we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain. It's a time when your ordinary, day-to-day life has an inordinate impact on who you will become. But what we hear less about is that there's such a thing as adult development, and our 20s are that critical period of adult development. \r\n\r\n05:03\r\n\r\nBut this isn't what twentysomethings are hearing. Newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood. Researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence. Journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings like \"twixters\" and \"kidults.\" \r\n\r\n05:20\r\n\r\n(Laughing) It's true! \r\n\r\n05:22\r\n\r\nAs a culture, we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood. \r\n\r\n05:31\r\n\r\nLeonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not quite enough time. \r\n\r\n05:37\r\n\r\n(Laughing) Isn't that true? \r\n\r\n05:39\r\n\r\nSo what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say, \"You have 10 extra years to start your life\"? Nothing happens. You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition, and absolutely nothing happens. \r\n\r\n05:56\r\n\r\nAnd then every day, smart, interesting twentysomethings like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this: \"I know my boyfriend's no good for me, but this relationship doesn't count. I'm just killing time.\" Or they say, \"Everybody says as long as I get started on a career by the time I'm 30, I'll be fine.\" \r\n\r\n06:20\r\n\r\nBut then it starts to sound like this: \"My 20s are almost over, and I have nothing to show for myself. I had a better résumé the day after I graduated from college.\" And then it starts to sound like this: \"Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs. Everybody was running around and having fun, but then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down. I didn't want to be the only one left standing up, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at 30.\" \r\n\r\n06:54\r\n\r\nWhere are the twentysomethings here? Do not do that. \r\n\r\n06:59\r\n\r\n(Laughter) \r\n\r\n07:00\r\n\r\nOkay, now that sounds a little flip, but make no mistake, the stakes are very high. When a lot has been pushed to your 30s, there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump-start a career, pick a city, partner up, and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time. Many of these things are incompatible, and as research is just starting to show, simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s. \r\n\r\n07:30\r\n\r\nThe post-millennial midlife crisis isn't buying a red sports car. It's realizing you can't have that career you now want. It's realizing you can't have that child you now want, or you can't give your child a sibling. Too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves, and at me, sitting across the room, and say about their 20s, \"What was I doing? What was I thinking?\" I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking. \r\n\r\n08:04\r\n\r\nHere's a story about how that can go. It's a story about a woman named Emma. At 25, Emma came to my office because she was, in her words, having an identity crisis. She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment, but she hadn't decided yet, so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead. Because it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition. And as hard as her 20s were, her early life had been even harder. She often cried in our sessions, but then would collect herself by saying, \"You can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends.\" \r\n\r\n08:48\r\n\r\nWell one day, Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap, and she sobbed for most of the hour. She'd just bought a new address book, and she'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts, but then she'd been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words \"In case of emergency, please call ...\" She was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said, \"Who's going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck? Who's going to take care of me if I have cancer?\" \r\n\r\n09:20\r\n\r\nNow in that moment, it took everything I had not to say, \"I will.\" But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist who really, really cared. Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance. I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex to just sit there while Emma's defining decade went parading by. \r\n\r\n09:44\r\n\r\nSo over the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that every twentysomething, male or female, deserves to hear. \r\n\r\n09:55\r\n\r\nFirst, I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital. By \"get identity capital,\" I mean do something that adds value to who you are. Do something that's an investment in who you might want to be next. I didn't know the future of Emma's career, and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: Identity capital begets identity capital. So now is the time for that cross-country job, that internship, that startup you want to try. I'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here, but I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count, which, by the way, is not exploration. That's procrastination. I told Emma to explore work and make it count. \r\n\r\n10:50\r\n\r\nSecond, I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated. Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport, but twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers limit who they know, what they know, how they think, how they speak, and where they work. That new piece of capital, that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle. New things come from what are called our weak ties, our friends of friends of friends. So yes, half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed. But half aren't, and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group. Half of new jobs are never posted, so reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that unposted job. It's not cheating. It's the science of how information spreads. \r\n\r\n11:44\r\n\r\nLast but not least, Emma believed that you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends. Now this was true for her growing up, but as a twentysomething, soon Emma would pick her family when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own. I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now. \r\n\r\n12:05\r\n\r\nNow you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20, or even 25, and I agree with you. But grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress. The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one, and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work. Picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you. \r\n\r\n12:45\r\n\r\nSo what happened to Emma? Well, we went through that address book, and she found an old roommate's cousin who worked at an art museum in another state. That weak tie helped her get a job there. That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live-in boyfriend. Now, five years later, she's a special events planner for museums. She's married to a man she mindfully chose. She loves her new career, she loves her new family, and she sent me a card that said, \"Now the emergency contact blanks don't seem big enough.\" \r\n\r\n13:20\r\n\r\nNow Emma's story made that sound easy, but that's what I love about working with twentysomethings. They are so easy to help. Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX, bound for somewhere west. Right after takeoff, a slight change in course is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji. Likewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29, one good conversation, one good break, one good TED Talk, can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come. \r\n\r\n13:59\r\n\r\nSo here's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know. It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex. It's what I now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day: Thirty is not the new 20, so claim your adulthood, get some identity capital, use your weak ties, pick your family. Don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do. You're deciding your life right now. \r\n\r\n14:30\r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\n14:31\r\n\r\n(Applause) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n00:03\r\n\r\n当我20几岁时， 我见到了我的第一个需要精神疗法的病人。 当时我是一个在伯克利大学 读临床心理学的Ph.D学生。 她是一位叫Alex的26岁女性。 第一次会面时Alex穿了 牛仔裤以及略微不修边幅的上衣， 进来后直接坐到我办公室中的沙发上， 踢掉她的鞋子， 然后跟我说她是来跟我讲男性问题的。 当我听到这个时，我松了一口气。 我的一个同学的第一个病人是一个纵火犯。 （笑声） 所以说，我有一个二十几岁的人 想跟我谈谈男生。 我以为我能处理好这事。 \r\n\r\n00:46\r\n\r\n但我没能办到。 Alex在每一次会面时 都会带来好笑的故事， 因此对我而言点点头， 不断拖延出结果的时间是一件非常轻松的事情。 Alex会说“三十就是新的二十”， 而且就我知道的，她是对的。 工作要以后才有，结婚以后才有， 孩子以后才有，连死亡都是以后才有。 像Alex和我一样是二十几岁的人除了时间外一无所有。 \r\n\r\n01:11\r\n\r\n但没过多久，我的监督就催我 开始推动Alex的爱情生活。 我拒绝了。 \r\n\r\n01:18\r\n\r\n我说：“没错，她现在在约会， 她和一个笨蛋同床， 但这并不表示她会和他结婚。” \r\n\r\n01:27\r\n\r\n然后我的监督说： “现在还没，但她可能会和下一个这样的人结婚。 再说，在Alex的婚事上花费精力的最好时间 就是在她结婚之前。” \r\n\r\n01:41\r\n\r\n这就是心理学家们所说的“原来如此！”瞬间。 在那一瞬间，我明白了三十岁并不是新的二十岁。 没错，人们比以前更晚安顿下来， 但这并不说明Alex的二十几岁这个时间段是她的发展低谷。 这使Alex的二十几岁一个发展的良好时期， 而我们就坐在那儿荒废它。 这时我才明白这种“善意的疏忽” 是一个非常现实的问题，而且它有严重的后果， 不仅是对于Alex和她的爱情生活 也对于各地的二十几岁的人的 家庭与未来。 \r\n\r\n02:18\r\n\r\n现在美国有大约5千万 二十几岁的人。 这大概是总人口的15%， 或者说100%如果你考虑到 没人能在不经历二十几岁这个阶段的情况下 经过成人期。 \r\n\r\n02:34\r\n\r\n如果你是二十几岁的话举一下手。 我非常想在这儿看到一些二十几岁的人。 太好了！你们都棒极了。 如果你和二十几岁的人工作，如果你爱一个二十几岁的人， 如果你因为二十几岁的人而失眠，我就想看到— 好的。棒极了，二十几岁的人非常重要。 \r\n\r\n02:51\r\n\r\n我专门研究二十几岁的人，因为我相信 这5千万个二十几岁的人中每一个 都应该知道每一个心理学家， 社会学家，神经学家以及生育专家 都知道的： 那就是把握你的二十岁这一个阶段是最简单的， 但又是最有影响力的你能为 你的职业，爱情，幸福， 甚至是全世界做的事。 \r\n\r\n03:19\r\n\r\n这不是我的观点。这是事实。 我们知道一个人的一生中的80%的最重要的时刻 发生在35岁。 这就意味着每10个 决定你的生命会是什么样的 的经历与“原来如此！”时刻 中有8个发生在三十岁中旬。 超过40岁的人，别慌。 我估计这个观众没问题。 我们知道一份职业中的前10年 对于你将会挣多少钱 有非常大的影响。 我们知道超过一半的美国人 30岁之前就和终生伴侣结婚， 同居，或者在约会。 我们知道大脑在你二十几岁时 为了适应成人期 达到第二次也是最后一次成长期的高峰， 这说明无论你想改变你自己的什么， 现在就是改变它的时间。 我们知道相比人生其他阶段 二十岁时的个性变化最大， 而且我们也知道女性的繁殖能力在28岁时达到峰顶， 到35岁之后事情就有点难办了。 因此你的二十几岁这个时间段就是 告诉自己自己的身体状况以及未来的选择的时候。 \r\n\r\n04:35\r\n\r\n因此当我们说到儿童发展， 我们都知道前5年是大脑发展 语言和爱慕的关键时期。 这是一个你的每日生活都会对你的未来 产生巨大影响的时间段。 但是我们听到的比较少的就是有一个东西叫 成人发展，而我们的二十岁这个阶段 就是成人发展的关键时期。 \r\n\r\n05:02\r\n\r\n但这并不是二十几岁的人所听到的。 报纸在描述成人的时间表的变更， 研究人员把二十几岁叫做延长的青春期。 新闻记者在给二十几岁的人附加愚蠢的外号， 比如“中间者”和“成年儿童”。 这是真的。 作为一种文化，我们把实际上是成人期中最重要的一个十年 列为不重要的东西。 \r\n\r\n05:30\r\n\r\n伦纳德 伯恩斯坦说过如果想办成大事， 就需要一个计划和不足够的时间。 这不对吗？ 所以说当你 拍一个二十几岁的人的头然后说： “你还有额外的十年才开始生活”时你认为会发生什么？ 什么也不会发生。 你剥夺了那个人的紧迫感以及志向， 但是什么都没发生。 \r\n\r\n05:55\r\n\r\n然后每天就有像你们的儿子或者女儿一样 既聪明又有趣的二十几岁的人 跑到我的办公室跟我说 “我知道我的男朋友对我一点好处都没有， 但这段感情不算数。我只是在消耗时间。” 或者是“大家都说只要我在30岁之前 开始我的职业就没问题。”这一类的话。 \r\n\r\n06:20\r\n\r\n但后来他们就开始讲： “我的二十岁快结束了，但我没什么可以展现的。 我毕业那天最好写写自己的简历。” \r\n\r\n06:32\r\n\r\n之后他们开始讲： “二十几岁时的约会就像玩抢座位游戏。 大家跑来跑去，乐在其中， 但到30岁左右音乐就停掉了， 大家一个接一个开始坐下。 我不想成为唯一一个站着的人， 因此有时候我觉得我和我丈夫结婚的原因 就是因为在我30岁时他是距我最近的‘椅子’。” \r\n\r\n06:54\r\n\r\n这里的二十几岁的人在哪儿？ 别做这种事。 \r\n\r\n07:00\r\n\r\n好吧，刚才那听起来可能有一点轻浮，但是别搞错， 在这里筹码非常高。 当很多事情被推到三十几岁再做时， 在你的三十岁这个阶段就有在极短的时间内 开始一个职业，挑选一个城市，找到一个伴侣 并且生几个孩子的巨大压力。 这些事情中有很多是不兼容的， 而且就如研究开始表明， 在三十几岁这个阶段同时完成这么多事 的压力以及难度实在是太大了。 \r\n\r\n07:29\r\n\r\n上个千年之后的中年危机 不在于能否买一辆红色的敞篷车。 是在于发现自己的职业不是自己想要的。 是在于发现你无法生你想要的孩子， 或者无法给自己的孩子一个同胞。 有太多太多的三十几岁的人和四十几岁的人 先看看自己，然后看看坐在房间另一边的我， 然后讨论他们的二十几岁这个时间段。 “我当时在做什么？我当时在想什么？” \r\n\r\n08:00\r\n\r\n我想改变二十几岁的人 的所做与所思。 \r\n\r\n08:04\r\n\r\n我来讲一个关于如何这么做的故事。 这是一个关于一位叫Emma的女性的故事。 25岁时，Emma来到我的办公室 因为她，用她的话来讲，正在经历一个身份危机。 她说她认为她想从事艺术 或者娱乐，但她还没决定， 所以前几年她花在做服务员上了。 因为比较便宜，她和她那 展现脾气比志向更频繁的男朋友住在一起。 而无论她的二十几岁有多么困难， 她以前的生活更困难。 她在会面时经常哭， 但会说“你无法选择你的家庭，但是你能选择你的朋友。” 然后平定下来。 \r\n\r\n08:48\r\n\r\n有一天，Emma走进来， 把头放在膝盖上， 然后哭了近一个小时。 她刚买了一个新的地址薄， 然后她花了一个上午填她的联系人， 但是她只能呆呆的看着 “在紧急情况下，请拨打...\" 这一串字后面的空白。 她近歇斯底里的看着我并说： “如果我出车祸了谁会照顾我？ 如果我的癌症了谁会照顾我？” \r\n\r\n09:20\r\n\r\n当时，我花了很大力气 才避免说“我会”。 但Emma需要的并不是一位非常非常关心 她的治疗师。 Emma需要一个更好的生活，而且我知道这是她的机会。 自从我在Alex身上下功夫后我学到了很多， 所以我不会让Emma那具有决定作用的十年 就这么流逝掉。 \r\n\r\n09:44\r\n\r\n所以在接下来的几周和几个月中， 我告诉了Emma 三个每个二十几岁的人，不论男女， 都应该听到东西。 \r\n\r\n09:54\r\n\r\n首先，我告诉Emma忘了她的身份危机 然后开始积累身份资本。 我所说的“积累身份资本”就是指 为你自己增加价值。 做一项对你接下来想是什么样子的 的投资。 我当时不知道Emma的职业的未来， 而且没人知道自己的工作的未来，但是我知道这些： 身份资本会招来更多的身份资本。 这是接受那份跨国职业， 那份实习和你想试试的那个起步的时候。 我不是在漠视二十几岁的人的探索， 但是我在漠视毫无意义的探索， 而且那些按道理来讲不能叫探索。 那叫拖延时间。 我叫Emma试验各种工作而且让它们算数。 \r\n\r\n10:49\r\n\r\n其次，我告诉Emma城市部落被高估了。 找好朋友来搭车至机场很棒， 但二十几岁的人若和思维方式 相似的同龄人聚在一起，他们所知道的人， 他们所知道的事，他们的思维方式，他们的讲话方式 以及他们的工作地点就会受到限制。 那个新的资本，那个新的可以约出去的人 几乎总是从内部圈子之外来的。 新的事物从我们所谓的微弱的联系中来， 比如我们的朋友的朋友的朋友。 是的，大概有一半的二十几岁的人未就业或者未充分就业。 但有一半不是这样的，而微弱的联系 就是把你自己加入那一个团体的方式。 有一半的新职位不会被张贴出来， 而联系到你的邻居的老板 就是你拿到那份未被张贴的工作的方法。 这不是作弊。这是关于信息如何传递的科学。 \r\n\r\n11:44\r\n\r\n最后，Emma相信 一个人不能选择家庭，但可以选择朋友。 在她的成长过程中这是没错的， 但作为一个二十几岁的人，很快Emma就要通过 和某人结伴，创造一个家庭 来选择她自己的家庭。 我告诉Emma选择家庭的时间就是现在。 你可能会认为30岁是一个 比20岁，甚至是25岁更好的 安定下来的时间， 而且我也同意。 但当你在别的人开始进入结婚礼堂时 抓紧和你同居或睡觉的人 不叫进步。 在婚事上下功夫的最好时间 就是结婚之前， 意思就是对待爱情就要像对待工作一样 富有意识。 选择家庭就是有意识的选择 你想要的人和物 而不是单单想让事情成功或者和 选择你的那个人浪费时间。 \r\n\r\n12:44\r\n\r\n那Emma后来怎么样了？ 嗯，我们翻了翻那个地址薄， 然后她发现她的一个老室友的一位亲人 在另一个州的一个艺术博物馆工作。 那个微弱的联系帮她在那里找到一份工作。 那份工作给她一个 离开她的同居男友的理由。 现在，5年过去了，她是一些博物馆的特殊活动规划者。 她和一位她有意识地选择了的人结婚了。 她爱她的新职业，她爱他的新家庭， 她还给我一张上面写着 “现在紧急联系人一栏 似乎不够大了。”的卡片。 \r\n\r\n13:20\r\n\r\nEmma的故事让这件事听起来非常简单， 但这就是我喜欢和二十几岁的人工作的原因。 要帮助他们实在太容易了。 二十几岁的人就像刚离开洛杉矶国际机场的 目的地在西边某地的航班。 起飞之后，航线的一个小调整 就是落在阿拉斯加还是落在斐济的区别。 同理，在21岁或者25岁甚至是29岁时， 一个好的聊天，一次好的休息， 一个好的TED演讲可以对接下来的 几年甚至是几代人有非常大的影响。 \r\n\r\n13:58\r\n\r\n这里给出一个值得传播给 每个你认识的二十几岁的人的想法。 它和我学到的该跟Alex说的话一样简单。 它就是现在我有权利 每天对像Emma一样的二十几岁的人说的话： 30岁不再是新的20岁，所以把握好你的成年时期， 积累一些身份资本，利用你的微弱联系 并且选择好你的家庭。 别被你不知道的事或者没做的事 定义。 现在，你就在决定你的生命。 谢谢。 （掌声） "}}]);
