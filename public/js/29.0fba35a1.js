You can’t force someone to accept your help. |\n| **Don’t count your chickens before they hatch.**             | Your plans might not work out, so don’t start thinking about what you’ll do after you succeed. Wait until you’ve already succeeded, and then you can think about what to do next. |\n| **If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.** | Don’t trust other people to do important things for you.
