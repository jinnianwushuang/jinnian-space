VERB---\x3e** **THE REST OF THE SENTENCE** (noun)(verb)(adjective, adverb, noun, complement, or nothing). | Greg is kicking the ball now. The action verb is **kicking**. It describes what Greg is doing.  The wind blows constantly in Chicago. The action verb is **blows**. It describes what the wind does. He accepted my apology. The action verb is **accepted**. It describes what 'he' did. |      |\n| LINKING verbs                 | A **linking verb** is a verb that links (connects) the subject of the sentence to information about that subject.  Linking verbs do not describe action. | When using linking verbs, the sentence structure will be : **SUBJECT---\x3e****LINKING VERB---\x3e** **INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUBJECT** (noun)(verb)(adjective, noun, or complement) | **to be** (is, am, are, was, were, has been, have been, had been, is being, are being, was being, will have been, etc.) **to become** (become, becomes, became, has become, have become, had become, will become, will have become, etc.) **to seem** (seemed, seeming, seems, has seemed, have seemed, had seemed, is seeming, are seeming, was seeming, were seeming, will seem) Here are some examples of linking verbs that are ALWAYS linking verbs in sentences: “The ball **is** red.”'Is' is a linking verb that connects the subject, ball, to information about that subject (that it is red). “The children **are** smart.”'Are' is a linking verb that connects the subject, children, to information about that subject (that they are smart). “The child **will be** tall five years from now.”'Will be' is the linking verb connecting 'child' to the fact that he will be 'tall five years from now.'“The cat **seems** fine.”'Seems' links the subject, cat, with information about the cat (that it is fine). “The dog **became** thin after his surgery.” 'Became' links the subject, the dog, with information about him (that he became thin). |      |\n| both ACTION and LINKING verbs | There are verbs that can be linking verbs in SOME sentences, but are action verbs in other sentences. One way to determine if the verb is functioning as an action verb or a linking verb is to substitute the word “is” for the verb in question. If the sentence still makes sense, then it is probably a linking verb. If the sentence would not make sense with the word “is,” then it is probably an action verb in the sentence. |                                                              | The following are examples of verbs that can be linking verbs in some sentences and action verbs in other sentences: look smell appear prove sound feel remain taste grow Here are some sample sentences of verbs used as linking verbs and actions verbs. Used as Linking Verbs Explanation Jane **appeared** uninjured after the accident. You could substitute the word 'is,' for the word 'appears,' and the sentence would still make sense: \"Jane is uninjured after the accident.\" This lets you know that **appeared** is a linking verb in this sentence. The cake **smells** good! This sentence describes the cake. “ **Smells**” is a linking verb in this sentence. It connects the subject, cake, with information about that subject—it smells good. The woman **grew** silent. This sentence may seem confusing. Remember that the word “grow” has more than one meaning! In this sentence, “grew” means BECAME. The woman **became** silent. Used as Action Verbs Explanation Before I could leave, Jane **appeared.** In this sentence, **appeared** is not linking anything. It is telling the action that Jane did. She appeared, or showed up. Ellen **smells** the cake. The word, **smells** is not linking anything. If you replaced smells with 'is' the sentence would not make sense. That means smells must be an action verb in this sentence. Ellen performed the action of smelling the cake. The gardener **grew** some flowers. The word, **grew**, is not linking two things together here. If you tried to replace grew with 'is' the sentence would not make sense. This means that grew must be an action verb. The gardener performed the action of growing some flowers. |      |\n\n## HELPING VERBS AND MODALS--助动词和情态动词\n\nHelping verbs\n\n**Helping verbs** are verbs that are used in a verb phrase (meaning, used with a second verb) to show tense, or form a question or a negative.  Helping verbs are used to show the perfect verb tenses, continuous/progressive verb tenses, and passive voice. Helping verbs are always followed by a second verb.  \n\nWhen using helping verbs to show tense, the sentence pattern will be: \n\n \n\n| SUBJECT ---\x3e                        | HELPING VERB ---\x3e | VERB 2 ---\x3e       | THE REST OF THE SENTENCE                         |\n| ----------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| **(noun, pronoun, or noun phrase)** | **(verb)**        | **(second verb)** | **(adj, adv, noun, prepositional phrase, etc.)** |\n\nWhen using helping verbs to form a question, the sentence structure will be:\n\n \n\n| HELPING VERB ---\x3e | SUBJECT ---\x3e                        | VERB 2 ---\x3e       | THE REST OF THE SENTENCE                         |\n| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| **(verb)**        | **(noun, pronoun, or noun phrase)** | **(second verb)** | **(adj, adv, noun, prepositional phrase, etc.)** |\n\nThere are three categories for helping verbs: \"**do**, **be**, **have**,\" **modals**, and **two-word modals**.**DO** **BE, HAVE****:** they help other verbs make questions, negatives, and some verb tenses. Remember-- DO, BE, and HAVE are only helping verbs when they are used with a second verb.\n\n**DO is a helping verb when it is used to indicate questions, negatives, and emphasis.**\n\n| **Questions with DO**                   | Do you have a car?              | These sentences are in question form. ***Do\\*/Does/Did** are used as helping verbs with ***have*** to make these sentences questions. |\n| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Does he have a car?                     |                                 |                                                              |\n| Did he have a car before?               |                                 |                                                              |\n| **Emphasis with DO**                    | I do want to go to the park.    | If you were responding to a statement like, \"You don't want to go to the park\" you may want to reply with great emphasis. Situations like that are perfect for using Do/Does/Did to show you really mean something. In these sentences **Do/Does/Did** are used with the verb ***want\\***. |\n| He does want to go to the park.         |                                 |                                                              |\n| They really did want to go to the park. |                                 |                                                              |\n| **Negatives with DO**                   | I do not want to go to the zoo. | ***Do/Does/Did*** are used as helping verbs to form a negative. In these sentences they are used with ***want***. The word ***not*** forms a negative response for each sentence. |\n| He does not want to go to the zoo.      |                                 |                                                              |\n| They did not want to go to the zoo.     |                                 |                                                              |\n\n**BE is a helping verb when it is used to form the continuous/progressive tense or to show passive voice.**\n\n| Continuous tense with BE                        | I am helping Diane right now.                 | These sentences use **Am**/**Was**/**Will** **Be** (forms of the verb BE) to form the continuous verb tense. **Am**/**Was**/**Will** **Be** are used with the verb ***helping.\\*** |\n| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| I was helping Diane when George paged me.       |                                               |                                                              |\n| I will be helping Diane when George comes home. |                                               |                                                              |\n| Passive voice with BE                           | The picnic is being canceled because of rain. | These sentences use **Is/Was/Will Be** with the second verb ***completed\\*** in order to show passive voice. |\n| The picnic was canceled because of rain.        |                                               |                                                              |\n| The picnic will be canceled because of rain.    |                                               |                                                              |\n\n**HAVE is a helping verb when it is used to show the perfect verb tenses, or used to form a question.**\n\n| Perfect tense with HAVE                                    | I have studied French for two years. | These sentences use **have/had** with the second verb ***studied*** to show the perfect tense. |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| I had studied French for two years before I went to Paris. |                                      |                                                              |\n| I will have studied French for three years in August.      |                                      |                                                              |\n| Questions with HAVE                                        | Have you seen that new movie yet?    | ***Have*** is used with the verb ***seen*** to make a question. |\n\n \n\nAnother kind of helping verb is called a **MODAL**. \n\n**Modals** are a special kind of helping verb that do not show tense and do not follow subject/verb agreement. They do not add 's' in the third person singular (he, she, it). They are not conjugated. They are used to show possibility, probability, and necessity. Like other helping verbs, modals are always followed by a second verb. But the second verb must follow a different conjugation pattern if a modal is present. The second verb can **never** add -**s**, -**es**, -**ed**, or -**ing**. It also cannot be in the infinitive form (to...) or in the gerund form (...-ing).\n\nWhen using **modals**, the sentence structure will be:\n\n \n\n| SUBJECT ---\x3e                        | MODAL ---\x3e                                | VERB 2 ---\x3e       | THE REST OF THE SENTENCE                         |\n| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| **(noun, pronoun, or noun phrase)** | **(should, would, could,may might, etc)** | **(second verb)** | **(adj, adv, noun, prepositional phrase, etc.)** |\n\n \n\n**Here are some common one-word MODALS:** these express probability, possibility, necessity, and \"if . . . would\" situations\n\n\n\n| could | shall | should |\n| ----- | ----- | ------ |\n| might | can   | must   |\n| may   | would | will   |\n\n**Here are some common TWO-WORD MODALS:** These also express probability, possibility, and necessity, but two-word modals use the word '**to**.'\n\n\n\n| used to     |\n| ----------- |\n| have to     |\n| have got to |\n| ought to    |\n\nHere are some examples of modals in sentences:\n\n| We can leave when you are ready.                            | '**Can**' is a modal that is part of the verb phrase, \"can leave.\" It means that we are able to leave when you are ready, but that it is not necessary that we leave. |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Bob will want to meet Sue.                                  | '**Will**' is a modal that must be part of the phrase \"will want.\" It shows that Bob definitely wants to meet Sue. |\n| Greg might play soccer.                                     | '**Might**' is a modal that is part of the phrase \"might play\" in this sentence.
