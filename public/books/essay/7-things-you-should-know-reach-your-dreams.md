# 7 Things You Should Know To Reach Your Dreams

Everyone has dreams and the wonderful thing is, you can have anything you want if you have the right attitude and take the right steps. Reach Your Dreams with these 7 valuable life hacks and have fun doing it!

## 1. Be Confident and Positive

This is the backbone for all the other tips to reach your dreams. The more positive you are, the more you are open to opportunities and success. Law of Attraction states that whatever you put out comes back to you — so as you see the best in things and as you think highly of yourself, you begin to attract the people and situations into your life that will lead you to what you want. Think about it: when you are feeling down and frustrated, you probably aren’t very clear, focused or connected. You may be looking at the ground worrying, instead of making eye contact and striking up a wonderful conversation that might just change your life. Happy, successful people surround themselves with other happy people. So be confident, be positive and appreciate the little things as well as the big.



## 2. Focus Forward & Visualize Your Dream

It can be all too easy to see how far you have to go and feel discouraged. Especially when you have inevitable setbacks. This is why it is so important to focus forward and visualize your dreams every day. Likely, your dreams won’t materialize overnight. But if you focus forward, and can see your dream in your mind before it happens, then your sub-conscious knows what to move toward. As you focus forward, imagine beautiful opportunities appearing before you. Imagine how good you feel living your dream life. Allow yourself to bask in this feeling and delight in the desire of what you want. As you do this, you are more open to receive goodness and your dreams will quickly begin to materialize. It can be extremely helpful to keep an appreciation journal, where you write down your dreams and goals in present tense. The whole point is to connect with how you will feel in your ideal future so you are feeling it Now. If you can do this, then you are half way there because you already feel great! You will raise your vibration closer to the vibration of your dreams. You will be confident and more positive, which makes you able to take inspired action that make your dreams come true!

## 3. Make Every Step Fun

So many of us have been taught that with enough hard work anything is possible. But this idea leaves out something very important: the people who truly reach their dreams, especially in the biggest ways, have fun along the way. If you do what feels good then you will feel happier. When you feel happier, you are more inspired. Find what makes you feel good and focus on it, because feeling happy and inspired every step of the way is key. As you let go of the old belief that success has to be hard, you see life becomes happier and easier. You won’t need will power because you are driven with happy inspiration and you will be excited to get the next step of your work done! As you make fun and happiness a priority, you will notice wonderful shifts, and creating your dreams in very big ways will become easier than you were ever led to believe.



## 4. Break Down Your Plans Into Little Pieces

Big dreams can be quite overwhelming in the early days. There is usually so much work to be done it can be overwhelming! By breaking it down into little pieces, you avoid becoming derailed before you even begin. Grab a pen or your computer and write down your desire. Then write what needs to be done. These are your topics. Once you have your list of topics, go another step further and break them down again. These little sub-headings are the tasks that need to be completed. For instance, if you are wanting to publish a book, a topic might be to ‘Find cover art’. The tasks might be to come up with concept, contact illustrators, send them samples of your writing, etc. Each one of these tasks is little. Even if you only do one or two a day, you can feel positive that you are going in the right direction step by step.

## 5. Don’t Listen To Negative People

Often when positive people have big dreams, others will try to pull them down. They might warn you and say you’re wasting your time or there won’t be any jobs. The same old story, really. People have been holding themselves back because they don’t believe in themselves. Don’t to listen to them! If you feel in your heart your dream is possible and you want to achieve it – then you CAN have it. Remember, the universe has limitless abundance available for all. It will always deliver to those who believe in their dream so much they feel it before it physically exists. This is a fundamental principal in Law of Attraction. Keep your dream alive and don’t listen to those who think it can’t be done. There are clearly hundreds and thousands of examples of people succeeding and making their dreams happen, seemingly against all odds. These are the people you want to be listening to.



## 6. Find Wise Help and Loving Support

On the flipside, you want advice, support and help from strong, positive people whom you admire. Surround yourself with friends, mentors and teachers who believe in the power of positivity. You are the sum of the people you hang out with. So choose those who believe in you and in themselves. Find wise help and support from people who have already succeeded and make friends who are clearly already on their way. You will know, because they find their dreams and goals fun! They are inspired to wake up and work towards their dream life. They lift you up and listen to your plans. They only give constructive feedback and will always tell you it can be done! Leaving old friends behind can be hard, but if you are going in a different direction and wanting to be the best you can be, you will naturally begin to make new friends who have the same ideals, goals and positive focus as you do.

## 7. Take Necessary Risks That Feel Right

Take risks that feel right! There will be some times when you’re not sure what to do. Sometimes you need to take a big risk to move forward. You may need to move to a new city and leave an old life behind, or perhaps you might go into a business venture that could make or break you. There will be risks along the way, but it’s important to only choose risks that feel good. The risks that will lead you in the right direction will feel special. There will be something about it that lifts you up. Your heart will urge you to move forward and say “Yes!”. You will feel light, and whenever you visualize your future, the outcome will be completely positive and look and feel good. Take care to note if you have conflicting warnings in your gut or your imagination takes you down a negative path — this might not be the right risk for you. So when an opportunity feels good and comes to you from a good place with good people, then even if it is risky, seize it because it might just be the next logical step to jump forward towards your dream life!
