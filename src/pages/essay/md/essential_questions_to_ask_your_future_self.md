## Meg Jay : Essential questions to ask your future self

#### 

00:00

Meg Jay: We need to talk about the empathy gap. So the empathy gap is why we sometimes hate on people on the other end of the political spectrum. Or it's why maybe we shrug their shoulders at the problems of those who look different or live different or love different than we do. It's why we almost certainly aren't doing enough to protect our kids and grandkids from climate change. It can just be difficult sometimes to care about people that we don't know or to do right by people who don't even exist yet. But what if I told you that that same empathy gap can also get in the way of us doing right by ourselves in our 20s and beyond? And before I go on, let me say that everything I'm about to talk about also applies to all of us out there who are well beyond our 20s. 

00:49

But for a little bit of background, in 2013, I gave a talk about why our twenties matter. So it's about almost 10 years later. I'm still a clinical psychologist who specializes in 20-somethings. But these days, the 20-somethings I see, they know their 20s matter. So they want to get them right. They want to move to the right city. They want to take the right job. They want to find the right partner. They want to have the right answers. Well, the bad news is there are no right answers. There are no right answers for where you should live or where you should work or how you should settle down. These are what are called "large world problems" because there are just too many unknowns. No app, no algorithm, no enneagram can ever solve these problems or answer these questions for you. 

01:37

But the good news is, because there are no right answers, there are no wrong answers. There are only your answers. So your 20s are a great time to listen to and be honest with yourself. They're a great time to have a conversation with your future self. So philosopher Derek Parfit said we neglect our future selves because of some sort of failure of belief or imagination. So I'm going to say that again, because it's really important: we neglect our future selves because of some sort of failure of belief or imagination. So when you're young, it can be difficult to imagine or believe that you could ever really be 35, especially when most of the influencers you see on Instagram or TikTok are younger than that. But that's a problem because research shows that our brains think about our future selves similarly to how they think about strangers. And that's where the empathy gap comes in. It can be difficult for us to care about a version of ourselves that we haven't met yet. 

02:44

Yet research also shows that if we find a way to close that empathy gap between our present selves and our future selves, we start to think more about what we could do now to be kind to ourselves down the line. So in one of my favorite studies on this, researchers used virtual reality to show 20-somethings what they would look like when they're old. Scary, I know, but the 20-somethings who saw their age-morphed selves, set aside more money towards retirement than those who didn't. So I don't have virtual reality in my office and saving for retirement isn't something that comes up a whole lot. But what does come up a whole lot is that about 85 percent of life's most defining moments take place by around age 35. So I ask my clients to imagine themselves at age 35 and I ask them to believe in their ability to have created those defining moments. And then I ask them to get really specific about what they see. What do I look like, where do I live, what do I do for work? Do I enjoy the work? Is it meaningful? Is it important? Does it pay well? Might these things be true one day? Which of these things do I really care about? What about after work? Who do I come home to? Do I have a partner? What does that relationship look like? How does it look different or similar to the ones that I saw growing up? Are there kids in the picture? How old was I when I had my first child? How old might I be when that child goes to college or has their own kids? And of course, am I happy, am I healthy? And what exactly do I do or not do that makes me happy and healthy? 

04:38

So the idea here is just to try to get to know your future self, because when we spend time connecting with that person, we do some reverse engineering and we start to ask our present self questions about how our present and our future can come together or meet somewhere in the middle, along the way. We start to ask questions like, "How is everything I think I want going to fit?" or "What does all this mean about what I need to be doing now?" Or here's one of my favorite questions to ask yourself at any age: "If I'm in a job or a relationship or a situation I would like not to be in in five years, then how much longer am I going to spend on this?" So, like I said, many of these are tough questions. But 20 years of doing this work has taught me that 20-somethings aren't afraid of being asked the tough questions. What they're really afraid of is not being asked the tough questions. And maybe that's because they've told the world that they're interested in having courageous conversations about race and class and politics and the environment. And perhaps at any age, one of the most courageous conversations you can have is with your future self. Thank you.

Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Thank you so much, Meg. That was wonderful. I'm glad to be here with you and with all of our members. And I know that your work is with people in their 20s, young adults. But you mentioned in your talk that this is something you can apply at any stage of your life and at any point. It's not just advice that you should use in your 20s, is that right? 

06:14

MJ: Oh, yes. I mean, I think our 20s is when we first start having to sort of figure out, "Oh, there's a future self out there. And I guess I better think about that person." Because, you know, like, school kind of does it for us, has us plot two or three years in advance. So our 20s are when we first start to think across those horizons. We get better at it over time. And then in our 30s, 40s, 50s, we have more built-in connections to the future. Like maybe if you have kids, you think, "Hey, I really want to be around when they graduate from college" or whatever the case may be. So there are there are ways we kind of -- it becomes a little bit more natural the older that you get. But it's always important. I have a couple in my practice right now and they're actually having a conversation with their future relationship, because in about five years, their kids are going to be leaving for college and they want to be sure they have a marriage they feel good about when the kids are gone. Or if I think about myself, I'm 51. So I'm having a conversation with my future self about, "Hey, you know, what do I want to get out of the years of my career that are just ahead in my 50s and, you know, time's running out. What is it I want to get done?" So I think we're, you know, we always need to be in conversation with our future self. It's just something that's new and usually quite difficult for 20-somethings. 

07:38

WPR: So I guess one thing I’m curious about is, you know, people have said, "OK, I like this idea of these questions. I want to ask myself these questions." And they do that. And then what happens? You know, I guess, what do you recommend people do next? What is the way that they can sort of take this further to advance themselves and this thinking? 

07:58

MJ: Yeah, so, you know, again, it depends on the goal or what ended up happening between you and your future self in this conversation. But I think like most long-form projects, so I would suggest some, you know, pencil and paper, do some math, sort of sketch out some things just to start with. And then as you go along, you might realize other things that are important to you down the line that you want to be sure that you get in there and add in there. And then I would figure out -- it depends on what it is, but a schedule that works for you, where you check in about your progress on, "Hey, am I being true to myself and to my future self in terms of what I said I was going to start prioritizing more." So maybe that check-in is once a month. Maybe it's every year on New Year's. Maybe it's your birthday. It really kind of depends. But I do think -- I mean, having this conversation one time because you heard my chat today and then dropping it is probably not going to do a lot for you. But if it's kind of the beginning of an ongoing conversation with yourself and like with any goal, it's probably something we need to keep circling back around on. "OK? Is this still what I want and how am I doing on this?" It kind of create some accountability. And so for that, that is where I think some people find, I'm going to tell a friend or I'm going to tell my pastor or I'm going to write it in my journal or whatever it is for you to kind of say, this is a goal that I'm going to own and I'm going to keep coming back to it. 

09:36

WPR: Have some sort of partner, even if that partner is yourself, your future self. 

09:42

MJ: Right. 

09:43

WPR: Well, Meg, thank you so much for being with us today, for your for your talk and for sharing so much of your wisdom around these questions and your 20s, and so much more. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 

09:55

MJ: Yeah, my pleasure. It was really fun. 



**梅格·杰:问未来的自己一些基本问题**

 
 00：00 
 梅格·杰:我们需要谈谈同理心缺口。同理心缺口就是为什么我们有时讨厌政治光谱另一端的人。或者这就是为什么我们对那些和我们长相不同，生活不同，爱不同的人的问题耸耸肩。这就是为什么我们几乎肯定没有做足够的工作来保护我们的孩子和孙辈免受气候变化的影响。有时候我们很难去关心那些我们不认识的人或者为那些还不存在的人做正确的事。但如果我告诉你，同样的同理心差距也会妨碍我们在20多岁甚至更大的时候做正确的事情，你会怎么想?在我继续之前，我想说，我将要讲的所有内容也适用于我们所有20多岁的人。 
 00：49 
 但是为了了解一点背景，在2013年，我做了一个关于为什么20多岁很重要的演讲。大概是10年之后。我还是个临床心理学家专门研究20多岁的人。但现在，我看到的20多岁的年轻人，他们知道20多岁很重要。所以他们想要正确的。他们想搬到正确的城市。他们想要接受合适的工作。他们想要找到合适的伴侣。他们想要正确的答案。坏消息是没有正确答案。对于你应该在哪里生活，在哪里工作，如何安定下来，没有正确的答案。这就是所谓的“世界大问题”，因为有太多的未知数。没有应用程序，没有算法，没有九形图能够解决这些问题，或者为你回答这些问题。 
 01:37 
 但好消息是，因为没有正确答案，所以也就没有错误答案。只有你自己的答案。所以20多岁是倾听和诚实面对自己的好时机。这是和未来的自己交谈的好时机。哲学家德里克·帕菲特(Derek Parfit)说，我们忽视未来的自己，是因为某种信念或想象的失败。所以我要再说一遍，因为这真的很重要:我们忽视了未来的自己，因为某种信仰或想象的失败。所以，当你还年轻的时候，很难想象或相信你真的能到35岁，尤其是当你在Instagram或TikTok上看到的大多数影响者都还不到35岁。但这是个问题，因为研究表明，我们的大脑对未来的自我的思考方式与他们对陌生人的思考方式相似。这就是同理心缺口的由来。对我们来说，去关心一个我们还没见过的自己是很困难的。 
 02:44 
 然而，研究也表明，如果我们找到一种方法来缩小现在的自己和未来的自己之间的同理心差距，我们就会开始更多地思考我们现在可以做些什么来善待自己。在我最喜欢的一项研究中，研究人员使用虚拟现实向20多岁的人展示他们年老时的样子。我知道这很可怕，但20多岁的人看到自己的年龄变化后，会比那些没有看到的人为退休留出更多的钱。所以我的办公室里没有虚拟现实设备，为退休储蓄也不是经常发生的事情。但经常发生的是，大约85%的人生最重要的时刻发生在35岁左右。所以我让我的客户想象自己在35岁的时候，我让他们相信自己有能力创造那些决定性的时刻。然后我让他们非常具体地描述他们看到的东西。我长什么样，我住在哪里，我做什么工作?我喜欢这份工作吗?它是有意义的吗?它是重要的?薪水高吗?这些事情有一天会成真吗?我真正关心的是什么?什么 
 下班后呢?我回家是为了谁?我有搭档吗?这种关系是什么样的?它和我成长过程中看到的有什么不同或相似之处?照片里有孩子吗?我第一个孩子是几岁?等孩子上大学或有自己的孩子时，我可能几岁?当然，我快乐吗，健康吗?到底做什么或不做什么能让我快乐和健康? 
 04:38 
 所以这里的想法只是试图了解未来的自己,因为当我们花时间联系那个人,我们做一些逆向工程开始问我们现在的自我问题关于我们的现在与将来可以一起或满足中间,。我们开始问这样的问题:“我认为我想要做的事情怎么样?”或者“这些对我现在需要做的事情意味着什么?”或者，这是我最喜欢问自己的问题之一，无论在任何年龄:“如果我正在从事一份工作、一段感情或一种我五年内不想从事的情况，那么我还要在这上面再花多长时间?”所以，就像我说的，很多问题都很棘手。但20年的工作经验告诉我，20多岁的人并不害怕被问到棘手的问题。他们真正害怕的是没有被问到棘手的问题。也许这是因为他们告诉世界，他们有兴趣就种族、阶级、政治和环境进行勇敢的对话。也许在任何年龄，你能和未来的自己进行的最勇敢的对话之一。谢谢你！ 
 05:54 
 惠特尼·潘宁顿·罗杰斯:非常感谢，梅格。这是美妙的。我很高兴在这里与你和我们所有的成员在一起。我知道你的工作对象是20多岁的年轻人。但是你在你的演讲中提到这是你可以在人生的任何阶段和任何时刻用到的东西。这不仅仅是你应该在20多岁时使用的建议，对吗? 
 06:14 
 答:哦,是的。我的意思是，我认为20多岁是我们第一次开始思考，“哦，未来的自己就在那里。”我想我最好想想那个人。”因为，你知道，就像学校为我们做的，让我们提前两三年计划。所以我们在20多岁的时候开始思考这些问题。随着时间的推移，我们会做得更好。然后在我们30多岁，40多岁，50多岁的时候，我们与未来有了更多的内在联系。比如，如果你有孩子，你会想，“嘿，他们大学毕业时我真的想在他们身边”或其他情况。所以有。有一些方法。随着年龄的增长它会变得更自然。但这总是很重要的。现在我有一些实践,他们实际上有一个对话与未来的关系,因为在五年内,他们的孩子要离开大学,他们想要确保他们的婚姻感觉良好时,孩子们已经一去不复返了。再想想我自己，我51岁了。所以我在和未来的自己对话，“嘿，你知道，我想从我50多岁的职业生涯中得到什么，你知道，时间已经不多了。我想做什么?”所以我认为我们，你知道，我们总是需要和未来的自己对话。对于20多岁的年轻人来说，这是一种全新的体验，而且通常是相当困难的。 
 07:38 
 WPR:我想我很好奇的一件事是，你知道，人们说，“好吧，我喜欢这些问题的想法。我想问自己这些问题。”他们就是这么做的。然后呢?你知道，我猜，你建议人们接下来做什么?他们是如何进一步提升自己和这种思想的? 
 07:58 
 MJ:对，这要取决于你的目标，或者你和未来的自己在谈话中最后发生了什么。但我认为像大多数长期项目一样，我会建议用铅笔和纸，做一些数学计算，从草图开始。然后随着你的学习，你可能会意识到其他对你很重要的东西你想要确保你在这里添加了这些东西。然后我会找到,这取决于它是什么,但适合你的时间表,你检查你的进展,“嘿,我是不是真的对自己和未来的自己而言,我说我要开始优先。”所以可能是一个月一次。也许是每年的新年。也许今天是你的生日。这要看情况而定。但我确实认为——我的意思是，有一次因为你听到了我今天的谈话而进行这样的对话，然后放弃它可能不会对你有多大帮助。但如果这是一种与自己的持续对话的开始，就像任何目标一样，它可能是我们需要继续绕回来的东西。”好吗?这仍然是我想要的吗?我该怎么做?”这就产生了一些责任。所以,这就是我认为有些人觉得,我要告诉一个朋友或我要告诉我的牧师或我要把它写在我的日记之类的对你说,这是一个目标,我将自己和我将继续回到它。 
 09:36 
 WPR:找一个伴侣，即使那个伴侣是你自己，你未来的自己。09:42 
 答:对的。 
 09：43 
 WPR:梅格，非常感谢你今天和我们在一起，感谢你的演讲，感谢你在这些问题和你20多岁的时候分享你的智慧，以及更多。谢谢你！谢谢你！谢谢你！ 
 09:55 
 MJ:是的，我很乐意。真的很有趣。
