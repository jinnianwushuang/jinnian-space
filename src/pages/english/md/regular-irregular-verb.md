## REGULAR VERBS

All **regular** verbs use the following forms to conjugate all verb tenses:

| **Verb-Form**      | **Explanation**                                              | **Example**        |      |      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ---- | ---- |
| Root Form          | The root form of the verb is its most basic form with no ***to\*** in front of it, and no ***-s\***, ***-ed\***, or ***-ing*** on the end. You will need to use the root form of the verb to form the simple future tense, some of the present tense, and with modals (should play, could play...). | I will **play**.   |      |      |
| Present Tense      | Use the root form of the verb for first person singular (I) and plural (we), second person (you), and third person plural (they) in the present tense. Add -s to the third person singular (he, she and it). | I **play.**        |      |      |
| Past Tense         | Add -ed to form the past tense.                              | I **played**.      |      |      |
| Past Participle    | Add -ed to form the past participle.                         | I have **played**. |      |      |
| Present Participle | Add -ing to make the present participle.                     | I am **playing**.  |      |      |
