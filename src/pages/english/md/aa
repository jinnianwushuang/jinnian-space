At first I wasn’t ready to accept your offer for the house. But you *drive a hard bargain* (negotiate effectively).
Jennifer’s presentation was *on point* (well done) – concise, relevant, and accurate.
The election is *up for grabs* (available). Everything is still very chancy.
The salary increase is still *up in the air* (not yet decided) – the boss favors it, but she hasn’t gotten approval from her superiors.
Sophia is *in hot water* (in trouble) with her department manager after she blew that sales presentation.
I’ll be *burning the midnight oil* (working late ) tonight, but I guarantee I’ll finish the paper before class tomorrow at 9.
I’ve been *out of work* (unemployed) since December. Hope I find a new job soon!
