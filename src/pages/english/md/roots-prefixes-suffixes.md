# The Roots of English

One of the best things for any writer to do is expand his or her vocabulary. Writing that relies upon a limited set of words becomes tiresome for readers — unless the book is by Dr. Seuss.

The quickest way to add variety to the vocabulary of a work is to buy a thesaurus or use the one included with your computer's operating system or word processor. Readers learn new words through context, assuming a writer does not overuse this power. One tip: do not replace a word you know with a word you do not know.

Writers wanting to expand their vocabularies should consider the following:

1. Read anything, especially articles on topics with which they lack familiarity;
2. Work crossword puzzles, without using crossword dictionaries;
3. Play games such as Scrabble® to exercise vocabulary and spelling; and
4. Learn the origin of many English words, also known as “roots.”

## Uncovering Roots

Words are composed of roots: **prefixes**, **suffixes**, and **bases**. The English language borrows roots from dozens of other languages. The most common roots come from the Latin and Greek languages.

## Latin Prefixes

The word *prefix* means *added before* or *affixed to the front*. Most prefixes are one or two syllables. In the following chart, prefixes following a semicolon are uncommon.
