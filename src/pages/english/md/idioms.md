If English isn’t your first language, or even if English is, idioms can be a little confusing. So often people fail to understand what exactly an idiom is, how to use it in everyday conversations, or how to spot or use them in writing. This guide should help you understand idioms more closely, and maybe give you some ideas about how to start using them yourself. So, what is an idiom?

## Idiom

### What is an Idiom?

Idioms occur in all languages on every continent throughout the world. They are known as a form of formulaic language. This type of language is not meant to be taken literally in most cases. These phrases are meant to have a figurative meaning that paints a picture in someone’s mind as a comparison for what is literally implied by the terminology being used. Most idioms come in the form of phrases known as idiomatic phrases. Idioms are used every day in all types of conversations and discussions about [many topics](https://7esl.com/english-idioms/#Idiom_Examples-2). They most often appear in informal conversations, but can also appear in formal discussions as well.

**Idiom Definition**

An idiom is a phrase or an [expression](https://7esl.com/expressions/) that has a figurative, or sometimes literal meaning. An idiom’s figurative meaning is different from the literal meaning.

Idioms are things that people say or write that when taken literally, don’t make sense. This can be quite confusing, but essentially they are ‘sayings’ or ‘phrases’ that are understood by English speakers in terms of their intended meaning, but when taken at face value the words together make little or no sense at all. An example might be somebody saying they were “*Over the moon*” because of something good happening in their lives. Taking that literally would leave somebody feeling quite confused, but most people understand that the individual is trying to say that they are *really* happy about something. There are many examples of idioms in English and we’ll take a look at a few more later, but why do we use them to begin with?

### **The History of Idiom**

Most idioms have an extensive history of being used over an extended period of time. Many have origsxxaxsxaxin the [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible) and even more are derived from Old English or [Latin phrases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases) and words. Well-known authors like [Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare), Chaucer, and many others have used or are solely responsible for the creation of some idioms in their works of poetry, drama, plays, and more. These well-known authors used idioms to prevent their writing from sounding bland, mundane, and repetitive by using the same old boring comparisons using both relative and literal terms. In fact, most of the popular idioms that we still use to this very day have stood the ultimate test of time having originated thousands of years ago.

### **Idiom Examples**

Native English speakers, or of any language for that matter, naturally inherit the knowledge to know what idioms mean because they have the benefit of hearing them every day as they grow up. However, when you are learning English as a secondary language and it is not your native tongue, idioms and other forms of figurative language can be extremely difficult to understand. Understanding them, however, is an essential part of being able to communicate effectively with those around you and for them to communicate effectively with you.

- **Hit the books:** this idiom simply means to study, especially with particular intensity. It is used as a verb – **hit** the books.
- **On the ball**: this idiomatic expression is used to reference someone that is alert, active, or attentive. If you say someone is “on the ball”, you mean that he or she understands the situation well.
- **Pull someone’s leg**: this idiom means to tease someone, to lead someone on, or to goad someone into overreacting.*“I hadn’t **pulled Ms Jane’s leg** for any of that stuff, she had just handed it to me on a platter, and that wasn’t my fault”*
- **Hit the sack:** This idiomatic phrase generally means to go to bed. You can also say “**hit the hay**” which has the same meaning.

### The Importance of Idioms

You might be wondering why we choose to complicate things by using idioms at all. Wouldn’t it just be easier to say what we literally mean? Well, yes, it might be *easier* but it would also be a little boring. Using idioms is a way of expressing ourselves figuratively instead of literally. It’s a way to express meaning on a more relatable and deeper level. When we hear idioms or read idioms we are able to use our imagination more to really understand the meaning that the person is trying to get across to us. It’s almost like we understand their meaning even more.

Take the “Over the moon” example from earlier. The person *could* just say that they are “really happy” about whatever it is that is making them happy. But by using the idiom and expressing themselves figuratively, we understand what they mean and it carries with it a little more meaning than the literal version of what they are trying to say. Essentially, we can form an image in our mind of this person being so overjoyed that they could jump over the moon with happiness. If that isn’t more meaningful than someone saying “I’m really happy”, then we don’t know what is.



Idioms are important because they allow people to express themselves in a more open and creative way. It allows the speaker or the writer to get a point across to somebody in a way that might not always be clear initially, but in the context of what they are saying makes perfect sense. They can be really good as a short way of expressing a more complicated idea. “Over the moon” is much easier than saying “I’m really happy, I could jump for joy and land on the moon”. Most people know what “Over the moon” means anyway, so it communicates the meaning clearly and quickly.

### Why Use Idioms in Everyday Conversations?

In short, because it would be difficult not to. We all know certain sayings or phrases from growing up, and that is exactly what an idiom is. Idioms can be universally understood, locally understood in your country/town/city/street, or even be understood just within your own family. Idioms are sewed into the fabric of the English language, wherever you’re speaking it. They are useful in everyday conversations because they get the meaning across without having to say very much at all. You save time, your meaning is clear in a [figurative sense](https://7esl.com/figurative-language) (even when it is not literally understood), and then you can move on to the next part of your conversation.

We use idioms in everyday conversations because they are phrases and sayings that are easily understood and quick to say. It makes sense to make use of this figurative way of conveying your message or getting your point across.

### How and When to Use Idioms in Writing

Unfortunately, it isn’t always acceptable to use idioms in writing. If, for example, you are writing something that is going to be placed on the internet for a potential worldwide audience, idioms might become confusing. You have to understand that idioms might be unique to you in some sense, and that others might struggle to understand what you are saying. With idioms, context is everything. People who are learning [English as a second language](https://7esl.com/) won’t be familiar with the quirky sayings and phrases that idioms represent, and sometimes even for people who have English as a first language might never have come across the *particular* idiom you are using. So, try to avoid idioms if you think your meaning might become unclear for your audience.

Idioms are also seen as quite an informal way of writing, so you should avoid using them for anything that needs to be formal in tone. Writing to a company that has just appointed you as their new Communications Manager for example, might not be the best time to tell them that you are “Over the moon” and that the task might be a “tall order” but you’re certain that you can “move the needle” and have everything ready “on the dot”. If those idioms confused you, don’t worry, they were supposed to… The point is, that meaning can get lost easily, and in formal or professional writing you should always aim to be as clear as possible.



That being said, if you are writing something that can be informal in tone and you know that the audience is going to understand your meaning because it’s commonly used in your local area or the meaning is easily deduced through context, then you absolutely should make use of idioms in writing! They are an excellent way of communicating an idea, and they will mean more to an individual who understands it than if you simply said everything literally.

Idioms are a very useful thing to understand in day to day life, and using them yourself now that you better understand them could save you time, express your meaning more clearly, and help people feel more connected to what you are saying or writing!

## **English Idioms | Images**

We use idioms daily for several reasons. When used as either a part of a conversation or as a part of writing, idioms have a way of making what we are attempting to say better. Idiomatic phrases add color and poetry to what we say and what we write. They also give us a way to make the people on the other end listening think outside the box due to their [figurative language](https://7esl.com/figurative-language/). It makes people stop and think “what did they mean by that?” Some idioms even invoke laughter from the listener or reader by making them picture something that seems highly unlikely. Finally, the usage of idioms makes great comparisons and these unlikely comparisons can impress readers and listeners of our work alike.**
